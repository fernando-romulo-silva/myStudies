Embedded Documents

Group data together logically
Great for data that belongs together and is not really overlapping with other data
Avoid super-deep nesting (100+ levels) or extremely long arrays (16mb size limit per document)

References

Split data across collections
Great for related but shared data as well as for data which is used in relations and standalone
Allows you to overcome nesting and size limits (by creating new documents)
