What is required to deploy DTR (Docker Trusted Registry) ?

a) A Docker Enterprise license from Docker Hub and an appropriate repository URL

b) Docker Enterprise Engine and Docker UCP

c) Docker Engine, a DTR license, and Docker Content Trust

d) All of the preceding options








































Answer 'a' and 'b'

'a' 
The DTR cache is going to be deployed as a Docker service

'b'
Weâ€™ll manage the cache configuration using a Docker configuration, and the TLS certificates using Docker secrets. 
This allows you to manage the configurations securely and independently of the node where the cache is actually running.
