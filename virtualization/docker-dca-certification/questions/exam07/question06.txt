How do we stop all replicas of the service web server, which is currently executing three replicas?


a) Using docker service stop webserver.

b) Using docker rm service webserver.

c) Using docker service update --replicas 0 webserver.

d) None of the preceding answers are correct.








































Answer 'c'

To stop all replicas of a service while keeping the service active in the swarm you can set the scale to 0. 
This is a cluster management command, and must be executed on a swarm manager node.
