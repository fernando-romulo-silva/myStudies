Which of the below Dockerfile directive would set up the base image 
that can serve as our starting point for establishing a new image?

a) ​FROM

b) BASE
​

​

Answer 'a'


The FROM instruction specifies the Parent Image from which you are building. 

FROM may only be preceded by one or more ARG instructions, which declare arguments that are used in FROM lines in the Dockerfile.
