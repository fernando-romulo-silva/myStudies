Bob has username "bob" on his linux system. 
He did a fresh installation of Docker and he doesn't want to preface docker commands with sudo. 
To which linux user group should he add himself to achieve that?

a) root
​
b) docker

c) admins
​
d) owner








































Answer 'b'


By default that Unix socket is owned by the user root and other users can only access it using sudo. 
The Docker daemon always runs as the root user.
If you don’t want to preface the docker command with sudo, create a Unix group called docker and add users to it. 
When the Docker daemon starts, it creates a Unix socket accessible by members of the docker group.
