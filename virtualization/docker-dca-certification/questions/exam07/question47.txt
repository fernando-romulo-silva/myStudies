Which command can you run on a manager node to retrieve the join command for a worker?

docker swarm get-token worker
​
B)
docker swarm join worker
​
C)
docker swarm show join-token
​
D)
docker swarm join-token worker










































Answer 'D'

Join tokens are secrets that allow a node to join the swarm. There are two different join tokens available, one for the worker role and one for the manager role. 
You pass the token using the --token flag when you run swarm join. 
Nodes use the join token only when they join the swarm.

1) Get the token
 
$ docker swarm join-token worker

To add a worker to this swarm, run the following command:

    docker swarm join \
    --token SWMTKN-1-3pu6hszjas19xyp7ghgosyx9k8atbfcr8p2is99znpy26u2lkl-1awxwuwd3z9j1z3puu7rcgdbx \
    172.17.0.2:2377


2) Join the cluster 
    
$ docker swarm join \
    --token SWMTKN-1-3pu6hszjas19xyp7ghgosyx9k8atbfcr8p2is99znpy26u2lkl-7p73s1dx5in4tatdymyhg9hu2 \
    172.17.0.2:2377
