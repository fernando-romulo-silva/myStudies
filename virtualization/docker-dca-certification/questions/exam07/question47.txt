In short, CMD defines default commands and/or parameters for a container. 
CMD is an instruction that is best to use if you need a default command which users can easily override. 
If a Dockerfile has multiple CMDs, it only applies the instructions from the last one.

On the other hand, ENTRYPOINT is preferred when you want to define a container with a specific executable. 
You cannot override an ENTRYPOINT when starting a container unless you add the --entrypoint flag.
