Answer 'b' and 'c' - Only 'Target' and 'Snapshot' use passphrase


Key	Description

root key - Root of content trust for an image tag. 
When content trust is enabled, you create the root key once. Also known as the offline key, because it should be kept offline.

targets	- This key allows you to sign image tags, to manage delegations including delegated keys or permitted delegation paths. 
Also known as the repository key, since this key determines what tags can be signed into an image repository.

snapshot - This key signs the current collection of image tags, preventing mix and match attacks.

timestamp - This key allows Docker image repositories to have freshness security guarantees without requiring periodic content refreshes on the clientâ€™s side.

delegation - Delegation keys are optional tagging keys and allow you to delegate signing image tags to other publishers without having to share your targets key.
