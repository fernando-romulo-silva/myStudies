Answer 'd'

Containers as a service (CaaS) is a cloud service model that allows users to upload, 
organize, start, stop, scale and otherwise manage containers, applications and clusters. 


Distributed Application Bundle, or DAB, is a multi-services distributable image format.
An image is a portable format for a single container. 
But Distributed Application Bundle, or DAB, is a new concept introduced in Docker 1.12, is a portable format for multiple containers. 
Each bundle can be then deployed as a stack at runtime.

Dockerfile -> Image -> Container

Docker Compose -> Distributed Application Bundle -> Docker Stack
