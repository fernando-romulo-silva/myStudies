Which of these swarm manager configurations will cause the cluster to be in a lost quorum state?

a) 1 manager of which 1 is healthy.
​
b) 3 managers of which 2 are healthy.
​
c) 4 managers of which 2 are healthy.
​
d) 5 managers of which 3 are healthy.








































Answer 'C'

So a quorum is a majority of managers.
In a swarm of N managers, a quorum (a majority) of manager nodes must always be available.

For example, in a swarm with 5 managers, a minimum of 3 must be operational and in communication with each other.

To ensure that quorum is achieved in the cluster, swarm managers use something called the Raft Consensus Algorithm. 

As long as less than (N-1)/2 (N being the total number of control nodes in your cluster) are affected at the same time, 
everything is fine and the cluster will not experience any service interruption. 

However, if more than (N-1)/2 control nodes in your cluster are down at the same time, the quorum will be lost, 
even if the affected control nodes restart successfully after that point.

A swarm with even number's node is not a recommended configuration for high availability, 
since there is no tie breaker manager in the event two managers disagree on state.

Ex 1:
    (5-1)/2 = 2  
    (5/2) + 1 = 3 
    
Lost in quorum when 3 nodes are down at same time     
Maintenance when they have 2 nodes healthy

Ex 2:

    (4-1)/2 = 2 
    (4/2)+ 1 = 3

Lost in quorum when 3 nodes are down at same time  
Maintenance when they have 2 nodes healthy
