Which of these swarm manager configurations will cause the cluster to be in a lost quorum state?

​
b) 3 managers of which 2 are healthy.
​
c) 4 managers of which 2 are healthy.
​

Answer 'd'

So a quorum is a majority of managers. 
To ensure that quorum is achieved in the cluster, swarm managers use something called the Raft Consensus Algorithm.
