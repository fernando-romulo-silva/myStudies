What step should we follow to remove the leader node from the cluster?

a) Ensure all tasks run on other nodes by executing docker node update --availability=drain <LEADER_NODE>.

b) Remove the node from the cluster as the leader by executing docker swarm leave on the node.

c) Demote the leader node to a worker and then execute docker swarm leave on the node.

d) Once the node is out of the cluster, we can remove it completely using docker node rm <OLD_LEADER_NODE> from any available manager.










































Answers 'a', 'c', and 'd'

'a' - When you drain a node, the scheduler reassigns any tasks running on the node to other available worker nodes in the swarm. 
It also prevents the scheduler from assigning tasks to the node.

$ docker node update --availability drain <NODE>


'c' - To demote a node or set of nodes, run docker node demote from a manager node:

$ docker node demote node-3

'd' - Removes the specified nodes from a swarm.

$ docker node rm swarm-node-02
