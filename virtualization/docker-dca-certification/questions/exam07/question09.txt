Describe what the RUN directive does.

a) The RUN directive sets the default command for the image.
​
b) The RUN directive executes a command on the host when building an image.
​
c) The RUN directive executes a command and commits the resulting changed files as a new layer in the image.
​
d) The RUN directive automatically runs a command when a new container gets created.








































Answer 'b'

The docker run command first creates a writeable container layer over the specified image, and then starts it using the specified command. 

The docker run command can be used in combination with docker commit to change the command that a container runs.
