What step is required to access images stored on a secure registry that is using a self-signed certificate?

a) We can configure our registry as "insecure" in Docker Engine's daemon.json file.

b) We should disable Content Trust to allow image pulling from unsecured registries.

c) The best option is to trust self-signed certificates. We will add DTR's created Certificate Authority (CA) into our system's trusted-CA list.

d) We cannot use self-signed certificates, therefore we always require an Enterprise-signed certificate.
