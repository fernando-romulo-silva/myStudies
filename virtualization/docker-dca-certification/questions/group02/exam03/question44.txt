Answer D

You can install Docker Engine in different ways, depending on your needs:

· Most users set up Docker’s repositories and install from them, for ease of installation and upgrade tasks. 
  This is the recommended approach.
  
· Some users download the RPM package and install it manually and manage upgrades completely manually. 
  This is useful in situations such as installing Docker on air-gapped systems with no access to the internet.
  
· In testing and development environments, some users choose to use automated convenience scripts to install Docker.
