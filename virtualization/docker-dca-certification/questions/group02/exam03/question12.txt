What is the purpose of a HEALTCHECK instruction within a Dockerfile?

A)
Defines the health check endpoint for external monitoring tools to monitor the health of the docker engine.

B)
Defines a heartbeat interval.

C)
To check if the server process is running.

D)
Instructs Docker how to test a container to check that it is still working.




































 
Answer D

The HEALTHCHECK instruction tells Docker how to test a container to check that it is still working. 

This can detect cases such as a web server that is stuck in an infinite loop and unable to handle new connections, 
even though the server process is still running.
