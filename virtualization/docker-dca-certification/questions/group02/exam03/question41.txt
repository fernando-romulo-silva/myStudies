Which of the following options best describes the procedure for backing up the Universal Control Plane (UCP) metadata?

A)
Run a container from the ucp image with the backup command.

B)
Create an archive for all of the data under the /var/data/ucp directory.

C)
Run a container from the ucp image with the uninstall-ucp command.

D)
Create an archive for all of the data under the /etc/docker/ucp directory. 





































Answer A

Backups contain UCP configuration metadata to re-create configurations such as Administration Settings values such as LDAP and SAML, 
and RBAC configurations (Collections, Grants, Roles, User, and more):

The following example shows how to create a UCP backup on a manager node, encrypt it by using a passphrase, decrypt it, 
verify its contents, and store it locally on the node at /tmp/mybackup.tar:

$ docker container run \
  –rm \
  –log-driver none \
  –name ucp \
  –volume /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
  –volume /tmp:/backup \
  docker/ucp:3.2.6 backup \
  –file mybackup.tar \
  –passphrase “secret12chars” \
  –include-logs=false

Here, the “docker/ucp” represents a docker image, “backup” is the command to execute.
