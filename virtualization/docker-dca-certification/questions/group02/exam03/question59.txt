Single sign-on (SSO) with UCP can only be configured at installation time?

A)
FALSE

B)
TRUE 











































Answer A

To only authenticate once, you can configure DTR to have single sign-on (SSO) with UCP.
Users are shared between UCP and DTR by default, but the applications have separate browser-based interfaces which require authentication.

When installing DTR, pass –dtr-external-url to enable SSO.
You can also enable single sign-on from the command line by reconfiguring your DTR.

To do so, run the following:

$ docker run –rm -it \
  docker/dtr:2.7.6 reconfigure \
  –dtr-external-url dtr.example.com \
