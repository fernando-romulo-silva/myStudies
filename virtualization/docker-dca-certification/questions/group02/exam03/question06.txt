Describe what the following instruction does when added to a Dockerfile.
HEALTCHECK CMD curl localhost:8080

A)
It adds a health status in addition to its normal status to detect cases such as a web server that is stuck in an infinite loop, 
even though the server process is still running.

B)
Defines the health check endpoint on the local host interface for containers to monitor the health of the docker engine.

C)
It adds a status to detect if a containerized application is running.

D)
Defines the health check endpoint on the localhost interface for external monitoring tools to monitor the health of the docker engine.



































Answer A

Every shell command returns a status code

The HEALTHCHECK instruction tells Docker how to test a container to check that it is still working.

The HEALTHCHECK instruction has two forms:

· HEALTHCHECK [OPTIONS] CMD command (check container health by running a command inside the container)
· HEALTHCHECK NONE (disable any healthcheck inherited from the base image)

When a container has a healthcheck specified, it has a health status in addition to its normal status.

The command after the CMD keyword can be either a shell command (e.g. HEALTHCHECK CMD /bin/check-running) 
or an exec array (as with other Dockerfile commands; see e.g. ENTRYPOINT for details).
