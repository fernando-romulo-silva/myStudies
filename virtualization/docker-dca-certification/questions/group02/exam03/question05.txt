Which of the following Dockerfile instructions will configure a starting point for the executable container?

A) ENTRYPOINT

B) ENV

C) CMD

D) EXEC









































Answer A

The RUN instruction will execute any commands in a new layer on top of the current image and commit the results. 
The resulting committed image will be used for the next step in the Dockerfile.

ENTRYPOINT instruction allows you to configure a container that will run as an executable. 
It looks similar to CMD, because it also allows you to specify a command with parameters. 
The difference is ENTRYPOINT command and parameters are not ignored when Docker container runs with command line parameters. 
(There is a way to ignore ENTTRYPOINT, but it is unlikely that you will do it.)

CMD instruction allows you to set a default command, which will be executed only when you run container without specifying a command. 
If Docker container runs with a command, the default command will be ignored. 
If Dockerfile has more than one CMD instruction, all but last CMD instructions are ignored.
