When using the Docker client to push an image to a registry, 
which environment variable is used to instruct the client to perform signing of the image?

A)
DOCKER_PUSH_SIGN=1

B)
NOTARY_ENABLE=1

C)
DOCKER_IMAGE_SIGN=1

D)
DOCKER_CONTENT_TRUST=1 




































Answer D

By default, when you push an image to DTR, the Docker CLI client doesnâ€™t sign the image.
You can configure the Docker CLI client to sign the images you push to DTR. 
This allows whoever pulls your image to validate if they are getting the image you created, or a forged one.

To sign an image you can run:
$ bexport DOCKER_CONTENT_TRUST=1
