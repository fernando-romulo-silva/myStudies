Which of the following endpoints exposed by Docker Trusted Registry (DTR) 
can be used to assess the health of a Docker Trusted Registry replica?

A)
/health

B)
/api/health

C)
/replica_status

D)
/nginx/health 




































Answer A

DTR also exposes several endpoints you can use to assess if a DTR replica is healthy or not:

* /health: Checks if the several components of a DTR replica are healthy, and returns a simple json response. 
  This is useful for load balancing or other automated health check tasks.

* /load_balancer_status: Checks if the several components of a DTR replica can be reached, and displays that information in a table. 
  This is useful for an administrator to gauge the status of a DTR replica.
  
* /nginx_status: Returns the number of connections being handled by the NGINX front-end used by DTR.

* /api/v0/meta/cluster_status: Returns extensive information about all DTR replicas.
