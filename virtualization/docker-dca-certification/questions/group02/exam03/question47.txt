Answer C

To backup the Swarm on Linux using Docker Engine >= 17.03, you can use the following steps.

Since this will need you to stop the engine of a manager, your cluster need to be healthy with at least 3 managers.
1. Select a manager node to do the operation. Try not to choose the leader one in order to avoid a new election inside the cluster.
2. Optional: Store the Docker version to a variable for easy addition to your backup name.
3. Stop the Docker Engine on the manager before backing up the data, so that no data is being changed during the backup.
4. Backup the entire Swarm folder /var/lib/docker/swarm.
5. Restart the manager Docker Engine.


Docker manager nodes store the swarm state and manager logs in the /var/lib/docker/swarm/

“/etc” is used for configurations (.conf files etc). 
  here you find all the configs and settings for your system.
  
“/var” is usually used for log files, ‘temporary’ files (like mail spool, printer spool, etc), databases, 
 and all other data not tied to a specific user. 
 Logs are usually in “/var/log”, databases in “/var/lib” (mysql – “/var/lib/mysql”), etc.
