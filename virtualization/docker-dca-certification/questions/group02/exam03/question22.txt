Which of the following Dockerfile instruction would set up the base image 
that can serve as a starting point for establishing a new image?

A)

The FROM instruction initializes a new build stage and sets the Base Image for subsequent instructions. 
As such, a valid Dockerfile must start with a FROM instruction.
