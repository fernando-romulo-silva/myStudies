What flag can you pass to docker run to set various restrictions on resource usage such as stack size, 
open files, processes etc.?

A)
--ulimit

B)
--resource-limit

C)
nproc 








































Answer A

–default-ulimit allows you to set the default ulimit options to use for all containers. 
It takes the same options as –ulimit for docker run. 

If these defaults are not set, ulimit settings will be inherited, if not set on docker run, from the Docker daemon. 
Any –ulimit options passed to docker run will overwrite these defaults.

Be careful setting nproc with the ulimit flag as nproc is designed by Linux to set the maximum number of processes available to a user, not to a container. 
For details please check the run reference.

$ docker run --ulimit memlock=819200000:819200000 \ 
             -h <docker_host_name> \ 
             --name=current \ 
             -v /home/user_home:/user_home \
             -i -d -t docker_user_name/image_name
