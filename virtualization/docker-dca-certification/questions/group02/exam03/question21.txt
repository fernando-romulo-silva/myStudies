Answer D

Prune unused Docker objects

Docker takes a conservative approach to cleaning up unused objects, 
such as images, containers, volumes, and networks: these objects are generally not removed unless you explicitly ask Docker to do so.

This can cause Docker to use extra disk space. For each type of object, Docker provides a prune command. 
In addition, you can use docker system prune to clean up multiple types of objects at once.


Prune images

The docker image prune command allows you to clean up unused images. 
By default, docker image prune only cleans up dangling images. 
A dangling image is one that is not tagged and is not referenced by any container. 
To remove dangling images:

$ docker image prune

To remove all images which are not used by existing containers, use the -a flag:
$ docker image prune -a
