Can a Dockerfile start with any command?

A)
FALSE

B)
TRUE











































Answer A

The FROM instruction initializes a new build stage and sets the Base Image for subsequent instructions.
As such, a valid Dockerfile must start with a FROM instruction.
ARG is the only instruction that may precede FROM in the Dockerfile.

For example:

ARG CODE_VERSION=latest
FROM base:${CODE_VERSION}
