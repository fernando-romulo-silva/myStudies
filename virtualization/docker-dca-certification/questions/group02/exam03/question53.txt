What is used by the kernel to provide isolation for resources when running Docker containers?

A)
Volumes

B)
Overlay networks

C)
Control groups

D)
Namespaces





































Answer D

Linux namespaces provide isolation for running processes, 
limiting their access to system resources without the running process being aware of the limitations.

Docker uses a this technology to provide the isolated workspace called the container. 
When you run a container, Docker creates a set of namespaces for that container.
These namespaces provide a layer of isolation. 
Each aspect of a container runs in a separate namespace and its access is limited to that namespace.
