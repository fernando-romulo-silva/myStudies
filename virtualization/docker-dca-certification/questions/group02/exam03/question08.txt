FROM keyword can only appear multiple times within the Dockerfile?

A)
TRUE

B)
FALSE











































Answer A

FROM can appear multiple times within a single Dockerfile to create multiple images or use one build stage as a dependency for another.
Each FROM instruction clears any state created by previous instructions.

You use multiple FROM statements in your Dockerfile for multi-stage builds. 
Each FROM instruction can use a different base, and each of them begins a new stage of the build. 
You can selectively copy artifacts from one stage to another, leaving behind everything you donâ€™t want in the final image.
