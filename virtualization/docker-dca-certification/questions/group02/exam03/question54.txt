Answer C

Docker Universal Control Plane (UCP) is the enterprise-grade cluster management solution from Docker.

With Docker, you can join up to thousands of physical or virtual machines together to create a container cluster that allows 
you to deploy your applications at scale. 

UCP extends the functionality provided by Docker to make it easier to manage your cluster from a centralized place.
