A user is having problems running Docker. 
How can you start Docker in debug mode?

A)
Set the debug key to true in the 'daemon.json' file.

B)
Start the 'dockerd' process manually with the '--raw-logs' flag set to debug

C)
Start the 'dockerd' process manually with the '--logging' flag set to debug

D)
Set the logging key to debug in the 'daemon.json' file. 















































Answer A

There are two ways to enable debugging. 
The recommended approach is to set the debug key to true in the daemon.json file. 
This method works for every Docker platform.

Find the daemon.json file, which is usually located in /etc/docker/. 
You may need to create this file, if it does not yet exist.

If the file is empty, add the following:
{
  “debug”: true
}

After the daemon.json file is modified, you should send a HUP signal to the daemon to cause it to reload its configuration. 
On Linux hosts, use the following command.

$ sudo kill -SIGHUP $(pidof dockerd)

Instead of following this procedure, you can also stop the Docker daemon and restart it manually with the debug flag -D. 

However, this may result in Docker restarting with a different environment than the one the hosts’ startup scripts create, 
and this may make debugging more difficult.
