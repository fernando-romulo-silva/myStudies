Tag an image referenced by user ID

B)
Tag an image referenced by Name and Tag

C)
Tag an image referenced by image ID

D)
Tag an image referenced by Name





































Answer A

To create a tag TARGET_IMAGE that refers to SOURCE_IMAGE use:
docker tag SOURCE_IMAGE[:TAG] TARGET_IMAGE[:TAG]

Examples:

Tag an image referenced by ID
To tag a local image with ID “0e5574283393” into the “fedora” repository with “version1.0”:
$ docker tag 0e5574283393 fedora/httpd:version1.0

Tag an image referenced by Name
To tag a local image with name “httpd” into the “fedora” repository with “version1.0”:
$ docker tag httpd fedora/httpd:version1.0

Note that since the tag name is not specified, the alias is created for an existing local version httpd:latest.

Tag an image referenced by Name and Tag
To tag a local image with name “httpd” and tag “test” into the “fedora” repository with “version1.0.test”:
$ docker tag httpd:test fedora/httpd:version1.0.test
