Answer 65

Docker Engine on Linux also relies on another technology called control groups (cgroups).
A cgroup limits an application to a specific set of resources.
Control groups allow Docker Engine to share available hardware resources to containers and optionally enforce limits and constraints.
For example, you can limit the memory or CPU available to a specific container.
