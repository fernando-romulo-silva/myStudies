Which command can you use on a node to join the current node to the swarm cluster as a worker node?

A)
docker swarm join worker

B)
None of the above

C)
docker swarm join --token

D)
docker swarm --join --token





































Answer A

The Docker Engine joins the swarm depending on the join-token you provide to the docker swarm join command.

To retrieve the join command including the join token for worker nodes, run the following command on a manager node:

$ docker swarm join-token worker

To add a worker to this swarm, run the following command with the output from the previous command:
    docker swarm join \
    --token SWMTKN-1-49nj1cmql0jkz5s954yi3oex3nedyz0fb0xx14ie39trti4wxv-8vxv8rssmk743ojnwacrr2e7c \
    192.168.99.100:2377

This node joined a swarm as a worker.
