How can you find untagged images?

A)
docker images --filter "tagged=false"

B)
docker images --format "tagged=false"

C)
docker images --filter "dangling=true"

D)
docker images --format "dangling=true" 





































Answer C

To show untagged images, or dangling, use:

$ docker images –filter “dangling=true”

This will display untagged images that are the leaves of the images tree (not intermediary layers). 
These images occur when a new build of an image takes the repo:tag away from the image ID, leaving it as : or untagged. 
A warning will be issued if trying to remove an image when a container is presently using it. 
By having this flag it allows for batch cleanup.
