Answers A, C and E

Docker Enterprise has three major components, which together enable a full software supply chain, 
from image creation, to secure image storage, to secure image deployment.

* Docker Engine â€“ Enterprise: 
The commercially supported Docker engine for creating images and running them in Docker containers.

* Docker Trusted Registry (DTR): 
The production-grade image storage solution from Docker.
DTR is designed to scale horizontally as your usage increases. 
You can add more replicas to make DTR scale to your demand and for high availability.
All DTR replicas run the same set of services, and changes to their configuration are propagated automatically to other replicas.

* Universal Control Plane (UCP): 
Deploys applications from images, by managing orchestrators, like Kubernetes and Swarm.
UCP is designed for high availability (HA). You can join multiple UCP manager nodes to the cluster, 
and if one manager node fails, another takes its place automatically without impact to the cluster.
Changes to the configuration of one UCP manager node are propagated automatically to other nodes.
