To decrease the time to pull images for geographically dispersed users you can configure which DTR option?

A)
DTR CDN

B)
DTR cache

C)
DTR Edge

D)
DTR Local Registry





































Answer B

Cache deployment strategy
The main reason to use a DTR cache is so that users can pull images from a service thatâ€™s geographically closer to them.

In this example, a company has developers spread across three locations: United States, Asia, and Europe. 

Developers working in the US office can pull their images from DTR without problem, but developers in the Asia and Europe offices complain 
that it takes them a long time to pulls images.

To address that, you can deploy DTR caches in the Asia and Europe offices, so that developers working from there can pull images much faster.
