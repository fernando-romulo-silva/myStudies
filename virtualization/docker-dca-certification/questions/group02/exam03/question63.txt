Which is the default logging driver of Docker for Linux distributions?

A)
none

B)
fluentd

C)
json-file

D)
syslog





































Answer C

To configure the Docker daemon to a specific logging driver, 
set the value of log-driver to the name of the logging driver in the daemon.json file.

The default logging driver is json-file.

To find the current default logging driver for the Docker daemon, run docker info and search for Logging Driver. 
You can use the following command on Linux, macOS, or PowerShell on Windows:

$ docker info –format ‘{{.LoggingDriver}}’
