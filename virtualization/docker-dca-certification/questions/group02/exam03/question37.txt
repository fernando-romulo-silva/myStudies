Repository metadata.

DTR Configurations

C)
Role-based access control (RBAC) settings.

D)
Docker images. 





































Answer D

DTR content backed-up
· Configurations – DTR settings and cluster configurations
· Repository metadata – Metadata such as image architecture, repositories, images deployed, and size
· Access control to repos and images – Data about who has access to which images and repositories
· Notary data – Signatures and digests for images that are signed
· Scan results – Information about vulnerabilities in your images
· Certificates and keys – Certificates, public keys, and private keys that are used for mutual TLS communication

DTR content NOT backed-up
· Image content – The images you push to DTR. This can be stored on the file system of the node running DTR, or other storage system, depending on the configuration. Needs to be backed up separately, depends on DTR configuration
· Users, orgs, teams – Create a UCP backup to back up this data
· Vulnerability database – Can be redownloaded after a restore
