Which of the following directive can primarily be used for defining default arguments for an executing container?

A)
CMD

B)
LABEL

C)
ENTRYPOINT

D)
RUN





































Answer A

The main purpose of a CMD is to provide defaults for an executing container. 

These defaults can include an executable, or they can omit the executable, in which case you must specify an ENTRYPOINT instruction as well.

If CMD is used to provide default arguments for the ENTRYPOINT instruction, 
both the CMD and ENTRYPOINT instructions should be specified with the JSON array format.
