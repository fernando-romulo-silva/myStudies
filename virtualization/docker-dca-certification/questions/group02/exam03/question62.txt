You are using self-signed UCP certs and have a second DNS name that points to your internal controllers (UCP). 
When installing UCP, which flag should you use to add this additional name?

A)
 -external-server-cert
 
B) 
--internal-server-cert

C)
--san

D)
--dns 




































Answer C

UCP always runs with HTTPS enabled. When you connect to UCP, 
you need to make sure that the hostname that you use to connect is recognized by UCP’s certificates.

If, for instance, you put UCP behind a load balancer that forwards its traffic to your UCP instance, 
your requests will be for the load balancer’s hostname or IP address, not UCP’s. 

UCP will reject these requests unless you include the load balancer’s address as a Subject Alternative Name (or SAN) in UCP’s certificates.
If you use your own TLS certificates, make sure that they have the correct SAN values.

If you want to use the self-signed certificate that UCP has out of the box, you can set up the SANs when you install UCP with the –san argument. 
You can also add them after installation.
