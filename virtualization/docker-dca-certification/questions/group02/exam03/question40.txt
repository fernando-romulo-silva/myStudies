Answers  A, B and C

To back up Docker Enterprise, you must create individual backups for each of the following components:
  1. Back up Docker Swarm. Back up Swarm resources like service and network definitions.
  
  2. Back up Universal Control Plane (UCP). Back up UCP configurations such as Access control, 
     Certificates and keys, volumes = All UCP named volumes, which include all UCP component certs and data, Monitoring data gathered by UCP
     
  3. Back up Docker Trusted Registry (DTR). Back up DTR configurations, images, and metadata, Repository metadata, Access control to repos and images, Notary data, Scan results.
  
If you do not create backups for all components, you cannot restore your deployment to its previous state.
Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) is part of UCP.
