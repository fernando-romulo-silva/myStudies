To configure Docker daemon to start as the system boots up, 
which of the following commands is correct for most Linux distributions?

A)
sudo systemctl start docker

B)
sudo systemctl up docker

C)
sudo systemctl enable docker

D)
sudo systemctl default docker




































Answer C

Most current Linux distributions (RHEL, CentOS, Fedora, Ubuntu 16.04 and higher) use systemd to manage which 
services start when the system boots. 
Ubuntu 14.10 and below use upstart.

$ sudo systemctl enable docker

To disable this behavior, use disable instead.

$ sudo systemctl disable docker
