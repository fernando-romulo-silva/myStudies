Answer C

ach Docker daemon has a default logging driver, which each container uses unless you configure it to use a different logging driver.

To configure the Docker daemon to default to a specific logging driver, set the value of log-driver to the name of the logging driver in the daemon.json file,
which is located in /etc/docker/ on Linux hosts or C:\ProgramData\docker\config\ on Windows server hosts.
