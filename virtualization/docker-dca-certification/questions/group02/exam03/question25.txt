Answers B and C

Most current Linux distributions (RHEL, CentOS, Fedora, Ubuntu 16.04 and higher) 
use systemd to manage which services start when the system boots. 
Ubuntu 14.10 and below use upstart.

$ sudo systemctl enable docker

To disable this behavior, use disable instead.

$ sudo systemctl disable docker
