With which flag should you run docker swarm init, after restoring a swarm backup, 
to ensure that the node does not attempt to connect to nodes that were part of the old swarm?

A)
-force-init

B)
--restore

C)
--force

D)
--force-new-cluster 




































Answer D

--force-new-cluster

This flag forces an existing node that was part of a quorum that was lost to restart as a single node Manager without losing its data.

$ docker swarm init --force-new-cluster
