Which of the following statements describe what the ENV directive does?

A)
It sets an environment variable on the host while the container is running

B)
It sets environment variables that are only visible during later build steps

C)
It sets environment variables that are made available in subsequent build steps and to containers at the runtime.

D)
It sets environment variables that are only visible at the container runtime.





































Answer C

Incorrect

The ENV instruction sets the environment variable to the value. 
This value will be in the environment for all subsequent instructions in the build stage.

Also, the environment variables set using ENV will persist when a container is run from the resulting image. 
You can view the values using docker inspect, and change them using docker run â€“env =.
