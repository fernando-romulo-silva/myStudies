Answers A and D

Docker namespaces provide a layer of isolation. 
Each aspect of a container runs in a separate namespace and its access is limited to that namespace.

Docker Engine uses namespaces such as the following on Linux:
· The pid namespace: Process isolation (PID: Process ID).
· The net namespace: Managing network interfaces (NET: Networking).
· The ipc namespace: Managing access to IPC resources (IPC: InterProcess Communication).
· The mnt namespace: Managing filesystem mount points (MNT: Mount).
· The uts namespace: Isolating kernel and version identifiers. (UTS: Unix Timesharing System).
