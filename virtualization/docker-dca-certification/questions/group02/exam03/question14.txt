In Docker Trusted Registry, how would a user prevent an image from being overwritten 
by another user which has push access to the repository?

A)
Keep a backup copy of the image on another repository.

B)
Tag the image with 'nginx:immutable'

C)
Use the DTR web UI to make the tag immutable.

D)
Remove push access from all other users. 




































Answer C

By default, users with read and write access to a repository can push the same tag multiple times to that repository. 

For example, when user A pushes an image to library/wordpress:latest, 
there is no preventing user B from pushing an image with the same name but a completely different functionality. 

This can make it difficult to trace the image back to the build that generated it.

To prevent tags from being overwritten, you can configure a repository to be immutable in the DTR web UI. 
Once configured, DTR will not allow anyone else to push another image tag with the same name.
