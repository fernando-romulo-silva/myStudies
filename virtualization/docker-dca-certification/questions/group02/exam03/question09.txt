What would be the output of the final pwd command of a container built from the following Dockerfile?

FROM alpine
WORKDIR /a
WORKDIR /b
WORKDIR c
CMD pwd

A)
/b/c

B)
/

C)
/c

D)
/a































Answer A

The WORKDIR instruction can be used multiple times in a Dockerfile.
If a relative path is provided, it will be relative to the path of the previous WORKDIR instruction. 
For example:

WORKDIR /a
WORKDIR b
WORKDIR c
RUN pwd

The output of the final pwd command in this Dockerfile would be /a/b/c.
