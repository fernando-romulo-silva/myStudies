C)

D)

Answer D

To create a UCP backup you should run the following command:

$ docker container run \
         –rm \
         –log-driver none \
         –name ucp \
         –volume /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
         –volume /tmp:/backup \
         docker/ucp:3.2.6 backup \
         –file mybackup.tar \
         –passphrase “secret12chars” \
         –include-logs=false

Here, the “docker/ucp” represents a docker image, “backup” is the command to execute.
This command should be run on a single UCP manager. 
This creates a tar archive with the contents of all volumes used by UCP and streams it to stdout. 

Additionally, you can include the version such as:
$ docker/ucp:3.2.6 backup
