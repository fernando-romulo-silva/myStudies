What represents a build context that should be considered when building an image?

A)
The configuration of the daemon

B)
Dockerfile found in a specific path or URL

C)
All the files found in a specific path or URL

D)
All dependencies already installed on docker-machine





































Answer C

The docker build command builds an image from a Dockerfile and a context.
The build’s context is the set of files at a specified location PATH or URL. 
The PATH is a directory on your local filesystem. 
The URL is a Git repository location.

A context is processed recursively. 
So, a PATH includes any subdirectories and the URL includes the repository and its submodules.

This example shows a build command that uses the current directory as context:

$ docker build .
Sending build context to Docker daemon  6.51 MB
…

You use the -f flag with docker build to point to a Dockerfile anywhere in your file system.

$ docker build -f /path/to/a/Dockerfile .

The build is run by the Docker daemon. 
The first thing a build process does is send the entire context (recursively) to the daemon.

In most cases, it’s best to start with an empty directory as context and keep your Dockerfile in that directory. 
Add only the files needed for building the Dockerfile.
