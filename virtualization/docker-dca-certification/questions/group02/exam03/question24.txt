Which of the following is not an endpoint exposed by Docker Trusted Registry (DTR) 
that can be used to assess the health of a Docker Trusted Registry replica?

A)
/api/v0/meta/cluster_status

B)
/nginx_status

C)
/replica_status

D)
/health




































Answer C

Health checks
DTR also exposes several endpoints you can use to assess if a DTR replica is healthy or not:

/health: Checks if the several components of a DTR replica are healthy, and returns a simple json response. 
This is useful for load balancing or other automated health check tasks.

/load_balancer_status: Checks if the several components of a DTR replica can be reached, and displays that information in a table. 
This is useful for an administrator to gauge the status of a DTR replica.

/nginx_status: Returns the number of connections being handled by the NGINX front-end used by DTR.

/api/v0/meta/cluster_status: Returns extensive information about all DTR replicas.
