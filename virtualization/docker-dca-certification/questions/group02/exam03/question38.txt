when added to a container? (Choose the 2 correct answers)

A)
 -end=[#]

B)
--cpus=[value]

C)
--limit=[#]

D)
--memory=[amount b/k/m/g]




































Answers B and D

–cpus=
Specify how much of the available CPU resources a container can use. For instance, if the host machine has two CPUs and you set –cpus=”1.5″, the container is guaranteed at most one and a half of the CPUs. This is the equivalent of setting –cpu-period=”100000″ and –cpu-quota=”150000″. Available in Docker 1.13 and higher.

-m or –memory=
The maximum amount of memory the container can use. If you set this option, the minimum allowed value is 4m (4 megabyte).
Most of these options take a positive integer, followed by a suffix of b, k, m, g, to indicate bytes, kilobytes, megabytes, or gigabytes.
