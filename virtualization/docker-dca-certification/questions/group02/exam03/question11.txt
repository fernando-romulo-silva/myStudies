Answer C

The docker image prune command allows you to clean up unused images. 
By default, docker image prune only cleans up dangling images. 
A dangling image is one that is not tagged and is not referenced by any container. 
To remove dangling images:

$ docker image prune


To remove all images which are not used by existing containers, use the -a flag:

$ docker image prune -a
