Which of the following constitutes a production-ready devicemapper configuration for the Docker engine?

A)
Utilize the '--storage-opt dm.directlvm_device' Docker daemon option, specifying a block device

B)
Nothing, devicemapper comes ready for production usage out of the box

C)
Create a volume group in devicemapper and utilize the '--dm.thinpooldev' Docker daemon option, specifying the volume group

D)
Format a partition with xfs and mount it at '/var/lib/docker'





































Asnwer A

Particular storage-driver can be configured with options specified with –storage-opt flags. 
Options for devicemapper are prefixed with dm.

Device Mapper configuration modes:

· loop-lvm mode – is only appropriate for testing. The loop-lvm mode makes use of a ‘loopback’ mechanism that allows files on the local disk 
  to be read from and written to as if they were an actual physical disk or block device.
  
· direct-lvm mode – Production hosts using the devicemapper storage driver must use direct-lvm mode. 
  This is faster than using loopback devices, uses system resources more efficiently, and block devices can grow as needed. 
  However, more setup is required than in loop-lvm mode.
