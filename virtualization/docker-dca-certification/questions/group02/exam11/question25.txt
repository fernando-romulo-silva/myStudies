A docker service ‘web’ is running with a scale factor of 1 (replicas = 1). 
Bob intends to use the command ‘docker service update –replicas=3 web’. 
Alice intends to use the command ‘docker service scale web=3’. 
How do the outcomes oft these two commands differ?

A)
Both Bob's and Alice's commands result in exactly the same outcome, which is 3 instances of the 'web' service.

B)
Bob's command updates the number of replicas of the 'web' service to 3. 
Alice's command results in an error.

C)
Bob's command only updates the service definition, but no new replicas are started. 
Alice's command results in the actual scaling up of the 'web' service.

D)
Bob's command results in an error. 
Alice's command updates the number of replicas of the 'web' service to 3.































Answer A

Containers running in a service are called “tasks” or “replicas”.
To scale the number of containers in the service you can use one of the following commands.

$ docker service scale=
$ docker service update –replicas=

For example, these commands are equivalent:

$ docker service scale web=5
$ docker service update –replicas=5 web
