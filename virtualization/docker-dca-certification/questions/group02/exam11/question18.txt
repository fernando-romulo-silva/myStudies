Which of the following commands starts a Redis container and configures 
it to always restart unless it is explicitly stopped or Docker is restarted?

A)
'docker run -d --restart-policy unless-stopped redis'

B)
'docker run -d --failure omit-stopped redis'

C)
'docker run -d --restart omit-stopped redis'

D)
docker run -d --restart unless-stopped redis'




































Answer D

$ â€‹docker run -d --restart unless-stopped redis


The value of the --restart flag can be any of the following:

* no : Do not automatically restart the container. (the default)

* on-failure : Restart the container if it exits due to an error, which manifests as a non-zero exit code.

* always : Always restart the container if it stops. If it is manually stopped, it is restarted only when Docker 
daemon restarts or the container itself is manually restarted.

* unless-stopped : Similar to always, except that when the container is stopped (manually or otherwise), 
it is not restarted even after Docker daemon restarts.
