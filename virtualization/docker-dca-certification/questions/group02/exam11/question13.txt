In Docker Trusted Registry, how would a user prevent an image, 
for example ‘nginx:latest’ from being overwritten by another user with push access to the repository?

A)
Remove push access from all other users.

B)
Keep a backup copy of the image on another repository.

C)
Use the DTR web UI to make the tag immutable.

D)
Tag the image with 'nginx:immutable' 




































Answer C

Tag Immutability enables customers to rely on the descriptive tags of an image as a reliable mechanism to track and uniquely identify images.

Docker tags are mutable named references to Docker images, much like branch refs in Git.

$ docker pull debian:buster 

DTR web UI help to make the tag immutable
