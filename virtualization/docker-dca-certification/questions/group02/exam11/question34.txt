Answer D

Docker tags convey useful information about a specific image version/variant. 

Tag an image referenced by ID
To tag a local image with ID “0e5574283393” into the “fedora” repository with “version1.0”:

$ docker tag 0e5574283393 fedora/httpd:version1.0


Tag an image referenced by Name
To tag a local image with name “httpd” into the “fedora” repository with “version1.0”:

$ docker tag httpd fedora/httpd:version1.0

Tag an image for a private repository
To push an image to a private registry and not the central Docker registry you must tag it with the registry hostname and port (if needed).

$ docker tag 0e5574283393 myregistryhost:5000/fedora/httpd:version1.0
