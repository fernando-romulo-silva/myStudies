If installing Docker using devicemapper for storage with the Intent to run production workloads, how should devicemapper be configured?

A)
loop-lvm

B)
direct-lvm

C)
aufs-lvm

D)
overlay-lvm





































Answer B

Production hosts using the devicemapper storage driver must use direct-lvm mode. 

This mode uses block devices to create the thin pool. 

This is faster than using loopback devices, uses system resources more efficiently, and block devices can grow as needed.
