Answer B

In terms of Docker Swarm services, a secret is a blob of data, such as a password, SSH private key, SSL certificate, 
or another piece of data that should not be transmitted over a network or stored unencrypted in a Dockerfile or in your applicationâ€™s source code.

The command to create a secret from a file or standard input (STDIN) as content is:
$ docker secret create [OPTIONS] SECRET [file|-]

Since this is a cluster management command, it must be executed on a swarm manager node.

Note: After you create a secret, you cannot update it. 
You can only remove and re-create it, and you cannot remove a secret that a service is using.

Secrets are encrypted during transit and at rest in a Docker swarm (The secret is stored in the Raft log, which is encrypted)
