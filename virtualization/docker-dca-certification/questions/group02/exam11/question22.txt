A service ‘wordpress’ is running using a password string to connect to a non-Dockerized database service. 
The password string is passed into the ‘wordpress’ service as a Docker secret. 
Per security policy, the password on the database was changed. 
Identity the correct sequence of steps to rotate the secret from the old password to the new password.

A)
Create a new docker secret with the new password. 
Trigger a rolling secret update by using the 'docker secret update' command

B)
Create a new docker secret with the new password. 
Remove the existing service using 'docker service rm'. 
Start a new service with the new secret using "--secret="

C)
Create a new docker secret with a new password. 
Trigger a rolling update of the "wordpress" service, by using "-- secret-rm" & "--secret-add" to remove the old secret and add the updated secret.

D)
Trigger an update to the service by using 'docker service update --secret=' 































Answer C

In terms of Docker Swarm services, a secret is a blob of data, such as a password, SSH private key, SSL certificate, 
or another piece of data that should not be transmitted over a network or stored unencrypted in a Dockerfile or in your application’s source code.

Note: After you create a secret, you cannot update it. You can only remove and re-create it, and you cannot remove a secret that a service is using.

Add or remove secrets

Use the –secret-add or –secret-rm options add or remove a service’s secrets.

For example:

$ docker service update \
     –secret-rm mysql_password \
     –secret-add source=mysql_password_v2,target=wp_db_password,mode=0400 \
     wordpress  

This triggers a rolling restart of the WordPress service and the new secret is used.
The following example adds a secret named ssh-2 and removes ssh-1:

$ docker service update \
    –secret-add source=ssh-2,target=ssh-2 \
    –secret-rm ssh-1 \
    Myservice
