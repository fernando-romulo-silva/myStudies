Each container shares common writeable container layer. True or false?

A)
FALSE

B)
TRUE











































Answer A

The major difference between a container and an image is the top writable layer. 

All writes to the container that add new or modify existing data are stored in this writable layer. 

When the container is deleted, the writable layer is also deleted. 

The underlying image remains unchanged.

Because each container has its own writable container layer, and all changes are stored in this container layer, 
multiple containers can share access to the same underlying image and yet have their own data state.
