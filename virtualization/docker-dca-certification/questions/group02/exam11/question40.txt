Which of the following statements is incorrect?

A)
The column 'size' of docker ps -s output shows the amount of data that is used for the writable layer of each container.

B)
The column 'virtual size' of docker ps -s output shows the amount of data used for the read-only image data 
used by the container plus the container's writable layer 'size'.

C)
When a container is deleted, the writable layer is persisted.

D)
Copy-on-write is a Docker strategy of sharing and copying files for maximum efficiency. 




































Answer C

When the container is deleted, the writable layer is also DELETED. 
The underlying image remains unchanged.
 
Because each container has its own writable container layer, and all changes are stored in this container layer, 
multiple containers can share access to the same underlying image and yet have their own data state.
