The following health check exists in a
Dockerfile: ‘HEALTCHECK CMD curl –fail http://localhost/health || exit 1′
Which of the following describes its purpose?

A)
Defines the health check endpoint on the localhost interface 
for external monitoring tools to monitor the health of the docker engine.

B)
Defines the health check for the containerized application so that 
the application health can be monitored by the Docker engine

C)
Defines the action taken when container health fails, 
which in this case will kill the container with exit status 1

D)
Defines the health check endpoint on the local host interface 
for containers to monitor the health of the docker engine































Answer C

The curl command checks whether the application is running or not making a request to localhost:3000. 
If the request returns a 200, it will return exit code 0; if the application crashes, it will return exit code 1. 
These exit codes are how Docker's HEALTHCHECK determines the health of the container.
