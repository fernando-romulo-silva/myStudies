What is one way of directly transferring a Docker Image from one Docker host in another?

A)
docker save' the image to save it as TAR file and copy it over to the target host. 
Then use 'docker load' to un-TAR the image back as a Docker image.

B)
There is no way of directly transferring Docker images between hosts. 
A Docker Registry must be used ad an intermediary.

C)
'docker commit' to save the image outside of the Docker filesystem. 
Then transfer the file over to the target host and 'docker start' to start the container again.

D)
'docker push' the image to the IP address of the target host.


































Answer A

You will need to save the Docker image as a tar file:

$ docker save -o <path for generated tar file> <image name>


Then copy your image to a new system with regular file transfer tools such as cp, scp or rsync(preferred for big files). 
After that you will have to load the image into Docker:

$ docker load -i <path to image tar file>
