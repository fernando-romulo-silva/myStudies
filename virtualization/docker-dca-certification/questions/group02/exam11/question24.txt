Which statement is true?

A)
CMD is used to run the software is the image along with any arguments

B)
CMD shell format uses this form ["param", param", "param"]

C)
ENTRYPOINT cannot be overriden in the "docker container run" command

D)
ENTRYPOINT cannot be used in conjuction with CMD







































Answer B

Both the ENTRYPOINT and CMD instructions support two different forms: the shell form and the exec form. 

In the example above, we used the shell form which looks like this:

CMD executable param1 param2

or

CMD ["executable","param1","param2"]

---------------------

A is wrong because:
 
One difference is that unlike CMD, you cannot override the ENTRYPOINT command just by adding new command line parameters. 
To override ENTRYPOINT you need to modify the docker run command following a specific syntax.

---------------------

B is wrong because:

RUN lets you execute commands inside of your Docker image. 
These commands get executed once at build time and get written into your Docker image as a new layer.

---------------------

C is wrong because we can combining ENTRYPOINT and CMD, 
It allows you to specify the default executable for your image while also providing default arguments to that executable which may be overridden by the user. 

FROM ubuntu:trusty
ENTRYPOINT ["/bin/ping","-c","3"]
CMD ["localhost"]
