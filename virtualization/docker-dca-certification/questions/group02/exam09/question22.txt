A)

C)
A configuration to backup and restore the swarm cluster’s current state on the docker host.

D)
A configuration to revive deleted containers on the Docker host.





































Answer B

By default, when the Docker daemon terminates, it shuts down running containers. 
You can configure the daemon so that containers remain running if the daemon becomes unavailable. 
This functionality is called live restore. 
The live restore option helps reduce container downtime due to daemon crashes, planned outages, or upgrades.
