While updating a swarm service, which of the following flags is used to configure the maximum number of service tasks that a scheduler can update simultaneously?


A)
--update-order

B)
--update-parallelism

C)
--update-max

D)
--update-max-failure-ratio 




































Answer B

Normally, updating a service will only cause the serviceâ€™s tasks to be replaced with new ones 
if a change to the service requires recreating the tasks for it to take effect. 

For example, only changing the --update-parallelism setting will not recreate the tasks, because the individual tasks are not affected by this setting. 
However, the --force flag will cause the tasks to be recreated anyway. 

This can be used to perform a rolling restart without any changes to the service parameters.
