local mode

bridge mode

C)
host mode

D)
802.3q trunk bridge mode





































Answer B

When you create a macvlan network, it can either be in bridge mode or 802.1q trunk bridge mode (is not 802.3q!!!) .

-> In bridge mode, macvlan traffic goes through a physical device on the host.

$ docker network create -d macvlan \
  --subnet=172.16.86.0/24 \
  --gateway=172.16.86.1 \
  -o parent=eth0 pub_net


-> In 802.1q trunk bridge mode, traffic goes through an 802.1q sub-interface which Docker creates on the fly. 
   This allows you to control routing and filtering at a more granular level.

$ docker network create -d macvlan \
    --subnet=192.168.50.0/24 \
    --gateway=192.168.50.1 \
    -o parent=eth0.50 macvlan50
