In which of the following modes can the macvlan network be created?

A)
local mode

B)
bridge mode

C)
host mode

D)
802.3q trunk bridge mode





































Answer B

When you create a macvlan network, it can either be in bridge mode or 802.1q trunk bridge mode.

-> In bridge mode, macvlan traffic goes through a physical device on the host.

-> In 802.1q trunk bridge mode, traffic goes through an 802.1q sub-interface which Docker creates on the fly. 
   This allows you to control routing and filtering at a more granular level.
