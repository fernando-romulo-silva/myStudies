Which of the following is used to store the non-sensitive information outside the service’s image or running containers in Docker?

A)
docker stats

B)
docker locker

C)
docker secrets

D)
docker config





































Answer  D

Docker swarm service configs allow you to store non-sensitive information, such as configuration files, outside a service’s image or running containers. 
This allows you to keep your images as generic as possible, without the need to bind-mount configuration files into the containers or use environment variables.

Docker configs are only available to swarm services, not to standalone containers. 
To use this feature, consider adapting your container to run as a service with a scale of 1.
