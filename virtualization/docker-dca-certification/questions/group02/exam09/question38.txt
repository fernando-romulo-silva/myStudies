What will happen if you use –mount flag to bind-mount container’s directory to a directory on Docker host which does not exist yet?

A)
Docker will create a new directory on Docker host and backup all the data of mounted container directory.

B)
Docker will create a directory with a warning of security vulnerabilities on Docker host.

C)
Docker won't create any directory on Docker host and generate an error message.

D)
Docker daemon will generate a warning and suggest to use --mount-to flag with directory location on Docker host to create that particular directory.





































Answer C

If you use --mount to bind-mount a file or directory that does not yet exist on the Docker host, 
Docker does not automatically create it for you, but generates an error.
