C)

D)

Answer C

Docker includes multiple logging mechanisms to help you get information from RUNNING CONTAINER and services. 
These mechanisms are called logging drivers. 
Each Docker daemon has a default logging driver, which each container uses unless you configure it to use a different logging driver, or “log-driver” for short.
But for the a RUNNING  CONTAINER, you need do it:

$ docker inspect murachs-mysql | grep -i -C 5 log
...
        "AppArmorProfile": "docker-default",
        "ExecIDs": null,
        "HostConfig": {
            "Binds": null,
            "ContainerIDFile": "",
            "LogConfig": {
                "Type": "json-file",
                "Config": {}
            },
            "NetworkMode": "default",
            "PortBindings": {
...



A is wrong because of the command bellow it's the docker daemon's log driver:

$ docker info --format '{{.LoggingDriver}}'

or

$ docker system info | grep -i log
