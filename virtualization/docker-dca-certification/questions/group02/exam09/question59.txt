What is the docker command to see container logs?

A)
docker logs

B)
docker debug

C)
docker dump-logs

D)
docker fetch-logs





































Answer A

The docker logs command shows information logged by a running container. 
The docker service logs command shows information logged by all containers participating in a service. 
The information that is logged and the format of the log depends almost entirely on the container’s endpoint command.
