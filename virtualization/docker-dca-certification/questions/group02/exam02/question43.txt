Which of the below statements is false about WORKDIR instruction?

A)
It affects only the build and does not impact containers that run from the image.

B)
The WORKDIR instruction can resolve environment variables previously set using ENV.

C)
It can use both absolute and relative paths.

D)
The WORKDIR instruction can be used multiple times in a Dockerfile. 





































Answer A

The WORKDIR instruction can be used multiple times in a Dockerfile.
· If a relative path is provided, it will be relative to the path of the previous WORKDIR instruction.
· If the WORKDIR doesn’t exist, it will be created even if it’s not used in any subsequent Dockerfile instruction.

The WORKDIR instruction can resolve environment variables previously set using ENV. 
You can only use environment variables explicitly set in the Dockerfile. 

For example:

ENV DIRPATH /path
WORKDIR $DIRPATH/$DIRNAME
RUN pwd
