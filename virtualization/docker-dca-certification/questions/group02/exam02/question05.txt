You need to host your organization’s event blog using WordPress and a MySQL database on a 25 swarm nodes cluster. 
You need to make sure that only one task of MySQL database service is deployed on each active node in the swarm cluster. 
Which of the following commands will achieve your goal?

A)
docker service create --name mySQL --global mysql

B)
docker service create --name mySQL --replicas=25 mysql

C)
docker service create --name mySQL --mode global mysql

D)
docker service create --name mySQL --config global mysql




































Answer B

You control the type of service using the –mode flag.
If you don’t specify a mode, the service defaults to replicated.
For replicated services, you specify the number of replica tasks you want to start using the –replicas flag. 
For example, to start a replicated nginx service with 3 replica tasks:

$ docker service create \
	–name my_web \
	–replicas 3 \
	nginx

To start a global service on each available node, pass –mode global to docker service create. 
Every time a new node becomes available, the scheduler places a task for the global service on the new node. 
For example to start a service that runs alpine on every node in the swarm:

$ docker service create \
	–name myservice \
	–mode global \
	alpine top
