Which of the Dockerfile directive executes any command in a new layer on top of the current image and commits the results?

A)
FROM

B)
CMD

C)
RUN

D)
ONBUILD





































Answer C

In the Dockerfile context, The RUN instruction will execute any commands in a new layer on top of the current image and commit the results.

Layering RUN instructions and generating commits conforms to the core concepts of Docker where commits are cheap and containers can be created 
from any point in an imageâ€™s history, much like source control.
