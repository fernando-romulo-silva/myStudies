ARG variables are persisted into the built image the same as the ENV variables.

A)
FALSE

B)
TRUE











































Answer A

The ARG instruction defines a variable that users can pass at build-time to the builder with the docker build command using the â€“build-arg = flag.

Unlike an ARG instruction, ENV values are always persisted in the built image.
The variable expansion technique in this example allows you to pass arguments from the command line 
and persist them in the final image by leveraging the ENV instruction.
