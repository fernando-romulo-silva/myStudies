Which of the following directive will execute a command at build time?

A)
CMD

B)
RUN











































Answer B

Donâ€™t confuse RUN with CMD. 
RUN actually runs a command and commits the result; 
CMD does not execute anything at build time, but specifies the intended command for the image.
