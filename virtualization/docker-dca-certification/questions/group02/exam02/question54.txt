Which docker entity can be described as “an executable package that includes everything needed to run an application–the code or binary, 
a runtime, libraries, environment variables, and configuration files”?

A)
Node

B)
Container

C)
Docker File

D)
Image




































Answer D

Fundamentally, a container is nothing but a running process, 
with some added encapsulation features applied to it in order to keep it isolated from the host and from other containers.

An image includes everything needed to run an application – the code or binary, runtimes, dependencies, and any other filesystem objects required.
