It is good practice to have more than one CMD instruction in the Docker file. 
True or false?

A) 
True

B) 
False










































Answer B

There can only be one CMD instruction in a Dockerfile. 
If you list more than one CMD then only the last CMD will take effect.
The main purpose of a CMD is to provide defaults for an executing container.
