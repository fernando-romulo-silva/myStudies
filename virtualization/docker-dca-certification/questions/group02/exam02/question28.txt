Which command needs to be executed to sign an image before pushing it to a repository?

export SIGN_DOCKER_IMAGE=1

B)
export TRUST_DOCKER_IMAGE=1

C)
export TRUST_DOCKER_CONTENT=1

D)
export DOCKER_CONTENT_TRUST=1





































Answer D

Docker Content Trust (DCT) allows you to verify the authenticity, integrity, and publication date of Docker images 
that are made available on the Docker Hub Registry.

By default, Content Trust is disabled. 
To enable Content Trust for signing and verifying Docker images that you build, push to, or pull from the Docker Hub, 
set the DOCKER_CONTENT_TRUST environment variable, for example:

$ export DOCKER_CONTENT_TRUST=1
