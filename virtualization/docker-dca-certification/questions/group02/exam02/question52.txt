What would be the output of the final pwd command of a container built from the following Dockerfile?

FROM alpine:latest
WORKDIR /a
WORKDIR b
WORKDIR c
CMD [ ‘/bin/bash’, ‘pwd’ ]

A)
c

B)
b

C)
/a/b/c

D)
/a 































Answer C

The WORKDIR instruction can be used multiple times in a Dockerfile.

If a relative path is provided, it will be relative to the path of the previous WORKDIR instruction. 
For example:

WORKDIR /a
WORKDIR b
WORKDIR c
RUN pwd

The output of the final pwd command in this Dockerfile would be /a/b/c.
