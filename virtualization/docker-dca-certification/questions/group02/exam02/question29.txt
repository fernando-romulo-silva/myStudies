What is the purpose of multi-stage builds?

A)
Better logical separation of Dockerfile instructions for better readability

B)
Better caching when building Docker images

C)
Faster image builds by allowing parallel execution of Docker builds

D)
Reduce the size of your final image since intermediate artifacts are left behind, and not saved in the final image.





































Answer D

Multi-stage builds allow you to drastically reduce the size of your final image, without struggling to reduce the number of intermediate layers and files.
With multi-stage builds, you use multiple FROM statements in your Dockerfile. 
Each FROM instruction can use a different base, and each of them begins a new stage of the build. 
You can selectively copy artifacts from one stage to another, leaving behind everything you donâ€™t want in the final image.
