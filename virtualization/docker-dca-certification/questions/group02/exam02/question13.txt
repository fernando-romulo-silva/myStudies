Answer B, C and D

Required Fields
In the .yaml file for the Kubernetes object you want to create, you’ll need to set values for the following fields:

* apiVersion – Which version of the Kubernetes API you’re using to create this object

* kind – What kind of object you want to create

* metadata – Data that helps uniquely identify the object, including a name string, UID, and an optional namespace

* spec – What state you desire for the object

Service Ex:

apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Service
metada:
  name: image-convert-service-svc
  namespace: general
spec:
  ports:
  - name: http
    port: 80
    protocol: TCP
    targetPort: 8080
