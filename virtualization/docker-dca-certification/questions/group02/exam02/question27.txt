(Choose two)

A)

B)
The ADD directive can extract an archive into the image.

C)
The ADD directive can pull a file from an external URL.

D)
The ADD directive can transfer a specific file between build stages. 




































Answers B and C

The ADD instruction operates similarly to the COPY instruction with two important differences.

The ADD instruction will additionally support:

· Fetch remote source files if a URL is specified

· Auto-extraction of archive files. Extract the files of any source that are determined to be of archive file type.
