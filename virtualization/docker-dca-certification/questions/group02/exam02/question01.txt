How do you view the list of historical tasks for a service called “redis” by using the command line?

A)
docker inspect redis

B)
docker service ps redis

C)
docker ps redis

D)
docker service inspect redis






































Answer B

The following command shows all the tasks that are part of the redis service:

$ docker service ps redis

In addition to running tasks, the output also shows the task history. 
For example, after updating the service to use the redis:3.0.6 image, the output may look like this:

$ docker service ps redis

ID             NAME      IMAGE        NODE      DESIRED STATE  CURRENT STATE          ERROR  PORTS
0qihejybwf1x   redis.1   redis:3.0.5  manager1  Running        Running 8 seconds
bk658fpbex0d   redis.2   redis:3.0.5  worker2   Running        Running 9 seconds
5ls5s5fldaqg   redis.3   redis:3.0.5  worker1   Running        Running 9 seconds


The number of items in the task history is determined by the –task-history-limit option that was set when initializing the swarm.
