It is good practice to have more than one RUN instruction in the Docker file?

A)
FALSE

B)
TRUE 











































Answer B

The RUN instruction will execute any commands in a new layer on top of the current image and commit the results. 

The resulting committed image will be used for the next step in the Dockerfile.

Layering RUN instructions and generating commits conforms to the core concepts of Docker where commits are cheap 
and containers can be created from any point in an image’s history, much like source control.

Therefore, it’s ok to have more than one RUN instruction.
