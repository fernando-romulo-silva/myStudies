The higher the number of managers in a swarm cluster, the better performance, and scalability. 
True or false?

A) 
True

B)
False










































Answer B

There is no limit on the number of manager nodes.

The decision about how many manager nodes to implement is a trade-off between performance and fault-tolerance.

Adding manager nodes to a swarm makes the swarm more fault-tolerant. However, additional manager nodes 
reduce write performance because more nodes must acknowledge proposals to update the swarm state. 

This means more network round-trip traffic.
