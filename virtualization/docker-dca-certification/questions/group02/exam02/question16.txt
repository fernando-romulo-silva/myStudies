A)
TRUE

B)
FALSE











































Answer A

Restart policies only apply to containers. 
Restart policies for swarm services are configured differently using other flags related to service restart.

Docker provides restart policies to control whether your containers start automatically when they exit, or when Docker restarts. 
Restart policies ensure that linked containers are started in the correct order. 
Docker recommends that you use restart policies, and avoid using process managers to start containers.
