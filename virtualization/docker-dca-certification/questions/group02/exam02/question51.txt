What represents a Dockerfile?

A)
A "readme" file for docker

B)
Executable file to install docker

C)
An archive with all necessary dependencies to install an app.

D)
A sequential set of instructions to build a docker image.





































Answer D

Docker can build images automatically by reading the instructions from a Dockerfile.

A Dockerfile is a text document that contains all the commands a user could call on the command line to assemble an image.

Using docker build users can create an automated build that executes several command-line instructions in succession.
