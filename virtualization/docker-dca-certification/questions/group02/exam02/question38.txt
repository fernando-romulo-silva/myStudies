Which directive informs Docker that a container listens on specified network ports at runtime?

A)
LABEL

B)
TAG

C)
ENV

D)
EXPOSE





































Answer D

The EXPOSE instruction informs Docker that the container listens on the specified network ports at runtime. 
You can specify whether the port listens on TCP or UDP, and the default is TCP if the protocol is not specified.

The EXPOSE instruction does not actually publish the port. 

It functions as a type of documentation between the person who builds the image and the person who runs the container, 
about which ports are intended to be published. 

To actually publish the port when running the container, use the -p flag on docker run to publish and map one or more ports, 
or the -P flag to publish all exposed ports and map them to high-order ports.

The ENV instruction sets the environment variable to the value. 
This value will be in the environment for all subsequent instructions in the build stage.
