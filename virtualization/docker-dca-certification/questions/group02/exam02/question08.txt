You have deployed a service to swarm. 
Using the Docker CLI how can you set the number of tasks of this services to 5? 
(Choose 2)

A)
docker replica update =5

B)
docker service scale = 5

C)
docker update service =5

D)
docker service update --replicas=5

E)
docker service replicas =5 
































Answers B and C

To scale one or multiple replicated services use:
docker service scale SERVICE=REPLICAS [SERVICE=REPLICAS…]

The following command scales the “web” service to 5 tasks:

$ docker service scale web=5

Alternatively, you can use:

$ docker service update –replicas=5 web

This example also updates the number of replicas for the service to 5.
