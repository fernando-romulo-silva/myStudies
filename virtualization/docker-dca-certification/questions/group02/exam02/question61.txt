Which of the following commands can be used to find the architecture and operating system an image is compatible with?

A)
docker image ls

B)
docker image inspect --format '{?{.Architecture}} {?{.Os}}'

C)
docker image inspect --filter '{?{.Architecture}} {?{.Os}}'

D)
docker image info





































Answer B

Docker inspect provides detailed information on constructs controlled by Docker.
By default, docker inspect will render results in a JSON array.

To display detailed information on one or more images use:
$ docker image inspect [OPTIONS] IMAGE [IMAGE…]

The options are:
–format , -f

Format the output using the given Go template

For the most part, you can pick out any field from the JSON in a fairly straightforward manner using the –format parameter.

$ docker inspect –format='{{.LogPath}}’ $INSTANCE_ID

$ docker image inspect --format '{{.Architecture}} {{.Os}}' nginx
