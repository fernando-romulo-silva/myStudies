B)
A docker-compose.yaml file

C)
A docker file

D)
docker commit




































Answer C

It is better to use Dockerfiles to manage your images in a documented and maintainable way. 
The Version Control can be used mainly for text-based files such as Dockerfiles, docker-compose.yml, and configuration files. 

Small binaries can also be kept in the same version control. 

Examples of version control are git, svn, Team Foundation Server, Azure DevOps, and Clear Case.

To create a new image from a container’s changes use:
$ docker commit [OPTIONS] CONTAINER [REPOSITORY[:TAG]]

It can be useful to commit a container’s file changes or settings into a new image.
This allows you to export a working dataset to another server.
