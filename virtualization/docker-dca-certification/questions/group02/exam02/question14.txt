One of the nodes in your existing cluster is logging errors related to the storage subsystem and it needs to be taken offline. 
Which command will allow you to gracefully remove the node when executed on the node itself?

A)
docker swarm leave --gracefully

B)
docker swarm unregister

C)
docker swarm leave

D)
docker swarm rm




































Answer C

To remove a node from the swarm use the following on the node itself:

$ docker swarm leave [OPTIONS]

When you run this command on a worker, that worker leaves the swarm.
You can use the –force option on a manager to remove it from the swarm. 
However, this does not reconfigure the swarm to ensure that there are enough managers to maintain a quorum in the swarm.

The safe way to remove a manager from a swarm is to demote it to a worker and then direct it to leave the quorum without using –force.
