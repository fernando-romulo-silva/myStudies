A)
False

B)
True











































Answer B

The ENV instruction sets the environment variable to the value. 
This value will be in the environment for all subsequent instructions in the build stage.

Also, the environment variables set using ENV will persist when a container is run from the resulting image. 
You can view the values using docker inspect, and change them using docker run â€“env =.
