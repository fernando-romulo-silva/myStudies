Which is one way of directly transferring a docker image from one docker host to another?

A)
Use docker commit to save the image outside of the Docker filesystem. 
Then transfer the file over to the target host and use 'docker start' to start the container again.

B)
There is no way of directly transferring Docker images between hosts. 
A Docker Registry must be used as an intermediary.

C)
Use docker save to save the image as a TAR file and copy it over to the target host. 
Then use 'docker load' to un-TAR the image back as a docker image.

D)
Use docker push to transfer the image to the IP address of the target host.


































Answer C

To save one or more images to a tar archive (streamed to STDOUT by default) use:
$ docker save [OPTIONS] IMAGE [IMAGEâ€¦]

The achieve can be distributed through different channels such as central file server, 
version-control system, sent it to you over email or shared it via flash drive.

Docker provides a command to load images into Docker from a file. 
With this tool, you can load images that you acquired through other channels.
