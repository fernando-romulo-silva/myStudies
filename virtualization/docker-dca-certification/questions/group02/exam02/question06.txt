Answer A

A Pod (as in a pod of whales or pea pod) is a group of one or more containers (such as Docker containers), 
with shared storage/network, and a specification for how to run the containers.

A Pod’s contents are always co-located and co-scheduled, and run in a shared context. 
A Pod models an application-specific “logical host” – it contains one or more application containers 
which are relatively tightly coupled — in a pre-container world, being executed on the same physical 
or virtual machine would mean being executed on the same logical host.
