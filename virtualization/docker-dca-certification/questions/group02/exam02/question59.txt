D)

Answer A

An ENTRYPOINT allows you to configure a container that will run as an executable.
You can override the ENTRYPOINT instruction using the docker run –entrypoint flag.

The main purpose of a CMD is to provide defaults for an executing container. 
These defaults can include an executable, or they can omit the executable, in which case you must specify an ENTRYPOINT instruction as well.

If CMD is used to provide default arguments for the ENTRYPOINT instruction, 
both the CMD and ENTRYPOINT instructions should be specified with the JSON array format.

The CMD instruction has three forms:

· CMD [“executable”,”param1″,”param2″] (exec form, this is the preferred form)
· CMD [“param1″,”param2”] (as default parameters to ENTRYPOINT)
· CMD command param1 param2 (shell form)
