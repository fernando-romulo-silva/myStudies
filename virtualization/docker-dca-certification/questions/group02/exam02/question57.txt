Docker reuses intermediate images for accelerating the docker build process.

A)
FALSE

B)
TRUE











































Answer B

In an image, a layer is modification to the image, represented by an instruction in the Dockerfile. 
Layers are applied in sequence to the base image to create the final image.

When an image is updated or rebuilt, only layers that change need to be updated, and unchanged layers are cached locally. 
This is part of why Docker images are so fast and lightweight. 

The sizes of each layer add up to equal the size of the final image.
