Both RUN and CMD instructions can be used interchangeably in the Dockerfile as they do the same thing.

A)
FALSE

B)
TRUE











































Answer A

The RUN instruction will execute any commands in a new layer on top of the current image and commit the results. 
The resulting committed image will be used for the next step in the Dockerfile.

CMD instruction allows you to set a default command, which will be executed only when you run container without specifying a command. 
If Docker container runs with a command, the default command will be ignored. 
If Dockerfile has more than one CMD instruction, all but last CMD instructions are ignored.
