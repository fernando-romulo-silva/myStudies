Which of the following flags can you use to specify a repository and a tag for saving the image after the build is done?

A)
-p

B)
-f

C)
-t

D)
-m




































Answer C

You can specify a repository and tag at which to save the new image if the build succeeds:

$ docker build -t myrepo/myapp .


To tag the image into multiple repositories after the build, add multiple -t parameters when you run the build command:

$ docker build -t shykes/myapp:1.0.2 -t shykes/myapp:latest .
