What happens when the RUN instruction is executed?

A)
The RUN directive sets the default command for the image.

B)
The RUN directive automatically runs a command when a new container gets created.

C)
The RUN directive executes a command and commits the resulting changed files as a new layer in the image.

D)
The RUN directive executes a command on the host when building an image.




































 
Answer C

In the Dockerfile context, The RUN instruction will execute any commands in a new layer on top of the current image and commit the results.

Layering RUN instructions and generating commits conforms to the core concepts of Docker where commits are cheap and containers can be created 
from any point in an imageâ€™s history, much like source control.
