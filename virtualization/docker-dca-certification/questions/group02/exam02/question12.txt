Setting a node to DRAIN also removes standalone containers from that node, and thus freeing it up completely.

A)
True

B)
False











































Answer B

Setting a node to DRAIN does not remove standalone containers from that node, 
such as those created with docker run, docker-compose up, or the Docker Engine API.

A node’s status, including DRAIN, only affects the node’s ability to schedule swarm service workloads.
