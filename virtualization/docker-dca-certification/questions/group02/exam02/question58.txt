A docker file must always be named Dockerfile?

A)
FALSE

B)
TRUE











































Answer A

The default filename is Dockerfile (without an extension), and using the default can make various tasks easier while working with containers.
However, you can name it whatever you like.
For example, check the following output:

$ docker build -f Myfile .
