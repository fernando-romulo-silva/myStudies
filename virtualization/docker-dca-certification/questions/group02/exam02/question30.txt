Which statement is true about building docker images?

A)
Only layers that have changed since the last build (and any following layers) are built.

B)
An image has state and it can change.

C)
Every Dockerfile can have only one FROM directive.

D)
Every layer of the image is re-built every time docker build is executed.





































Answer A

When an image is updated or rebuilt, only layers that change need to be updated, and unchanged layers are cached locally. 
This is part of why Docker images are so fast and lightweight. 
The sizes of each layer add up to equal the size of the final image.
An image does not have state and it never changes.
FROM can appear multiple times within a single Dockerfile to create multiple images or use one build stage as a dependency for another.
