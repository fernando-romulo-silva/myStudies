When using the RBAC model, you want to control access to swarm resources by using collections. 
Which of the following will enable you to do that?

A)
Docker labels

B)
None of the above

C)
Docker configs

D)
Docker secrets 




































Answer A

Docker Enterprise enables controlling access to swarm resources by using collections. 

A collection is a grouping of swarm cluster resources that you access by specifying a directory-like path. 

Before grants can be implemented, collections need to be designed to group resources in a way that makes sense for an organization.

The following example shows the potential access policy of an organization. 

Consider an organization with two application teams, Mobile and Payments, that share cluster hardware resources, 
but still need to segregate access to the applications. 

Collections should be designed to map to the organizational structure desired, in this case the two application teams.



Grant

"team B has Restricted Control on Collection X"

Subjects

*Organization*

Team A 

Team B (1)

*Roles*

No Access

Restricted Control (1)

*Collections*

X -> Node A, Secret B, Service A

Y -> Secret A, Stack C

Z -> Nobe B, Node C, Service B, Service C

-------------------

Collections are implemented in UCP through the use of Docker labels. 

All resources within a given collection are labeled with the collection, /production/mobile for instance.
