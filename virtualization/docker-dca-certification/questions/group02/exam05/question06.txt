Answer A

Seccomp (short for Secure Computing Mode) is a security feature of the Linux kernel, used to restrict the syscalls available to a given process. 

This facility has been in the kernel in various forms since 2.6.12 and has been available in Docker Engine since 1.10. 

The current implementation in Docker Engine provides a default set of restricted syscalls and also allows syscalls to be filtered via either 
a whitelist or a blacklist on a per-container basis (i.e. different filters can be applied to different containers running in the same Engine).
 
Seccomp profiles are applied at container creation time and cannot be altered for running containers.
