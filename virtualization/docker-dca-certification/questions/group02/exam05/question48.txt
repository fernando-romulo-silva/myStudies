Answer C

To inspect changes to files or directories on a container’s filesystem use:

$ docker diff CONTAINER

This lists the changed files and directories in a container's filesystem since the container was created.

Three different types of change are tracked with different symbols:

A A file or directory was added
D A file or directory was deleted
C A file or directory was changed
