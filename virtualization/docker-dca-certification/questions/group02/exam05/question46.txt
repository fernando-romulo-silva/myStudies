Data is stored in the host system`s memory when using what type of mount?

A)
tmpfs

B)
Regular

C)
volumes

D)
bind mounts





































Answer A

As opposed to volumes and bind mounts, a tmpfs mount is temporary, and only persisted in the host memory. 

When the container stops, the tmpfs mount is removed, and files written there won’t be persisted.

This is useful to temporarily store sensitive files that you don’t want to persist in either the host or the container writable layer.
