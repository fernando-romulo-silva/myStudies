If a container has files or directories in the directory to be mounted, 
the directory`s content is copied into the volume and then the volume is mounted.

A)
TRUE

B)
FALSE










































Answer A

If you start a container which creates a new volume, and the container has files or directories in the directory to be mounted, 
the directory’s contents are copied into the volume.

Then, the container mounts and uses the volume, and other containers which use the volume also have access to the pre-populated content.

To illustrate this, this example starts an nginx container and populates the new volume nginx-vol 
with the contents of the container’s /usr/share/nginx/html directory, which is where Nginx stores its default HTML content.

The –mount and -v examples have the same end result.

$ docker run -d \
  –name=nginxtest \
  -v nginx-vol:/usr/share/nginx/html \
  nginx:latest
