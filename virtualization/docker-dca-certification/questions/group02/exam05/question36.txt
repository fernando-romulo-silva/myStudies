Following the principle of least privilege, 
which of the following methods can you use to securely grant access to a specific user to communicate to a Docker engine?

A)
Utilize openssl to create TLS client and server certificates, configuring the Docker engine to use with mutual TLS over TCP.

B)
Utilize the '--host 0.0.0.0:2375' option to the Docker daemon to listen on port 2375 over TCP on all interfaces.

C)
Utilize the '--host 127.0.0.1:2375' option to the Docker daemon to listen on port 2375 over TCP on localhost

D)
Give the user root access to the server to allow them to run Docker commands as root.




































Answer A

You donâ€™t need to run the docker client with sudo or the docker group when you use certificate authentication. 
That means anyone with the keys can give any instructions to your Docker daemon, giving them root access to the machine hosting the daemon. 
However, guard these keys as you would a root password!
