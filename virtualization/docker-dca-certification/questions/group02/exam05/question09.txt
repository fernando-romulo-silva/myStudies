C)

D)
There no feature like this. 





































Answer B

Image Immutability

As of DTR 2.3.0, there is an option to set a repository to Immutable. 

Setting a repository to Immutable means the tags can not be overwritten. 

This is a great feature for ensure the base images do not change over time. 

This next example is of the Alpine base image. 

Ideally CI would update the base image and push to DTR with a specific tag. 

Being Immutable simply guarantees that an authorized user can always go back to the specific tag and trust it has not changed. 

An Image Promotion Policy can extend on this.
