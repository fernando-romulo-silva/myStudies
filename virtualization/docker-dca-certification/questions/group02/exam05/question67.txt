PersistentVolume cannot be provisioned on-demand. 
True or False?

A)
TRUE

B)
FALSE










































Answer B

A PersistentVolume (PV) is a piece of storage in the cluster that has been provisioned by an administrator or dynamically provisioned using Storage Classes.

https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/#persistent-volumes


Dynamic volume provisioning allows storage volumes to be created on-demand. 
Without dynamic provisioning, cluster administrators have to manually make calls to their cloud or storage provider to create new storage volumes, 
and then create PersistentVolume objects to represent them in Kubernetes. 

The dynamic provisioning feature eliminates the need for cluster administrators to pre-provision storage. 
Instead, it automatically provisions storage when it is requested by users.
