Are scan results of Docker security available in both UCP and DTR?

A)
TRUE

B)
FALSE











































Answer B

Docker Trusted Registry can scan images in your repositories to verify that they are free from known 
security vulnerabilities or exposures, using Docker Security Scanning.

Docker Security Scanning is available as an add-on to Docker Trusted Registry, 
and an administrator configures it for your DTR instance.
