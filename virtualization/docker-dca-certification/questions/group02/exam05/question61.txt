Which of the following statements is false?

A)
The column 'size' of docker ps -s output shows the amount of data that is used for the writable layer of each container.

B)
When a container is deleted, the writable layer is persisted.

C)
The column 'virtual size' of docker ps -s output shows the amount of data used for the read-only image data used by the container, 
plus the container's writable layer 'size'.

D)
Copy-on-write is a Docker strategy of sharing and copying files for maximum efficiency. 




































Answer B

To view the approximate size of a running container, you can use the docker ps -s command. 

Two different columns relate to size.

· size: the amount of data (on disk) that is used for the writable layer of each container.

· virtual size: the amount of data used for the read-only image data used by the container plus the container’s writable layer size. 
  Multiple containers may share some or all read-only image data. 
  Two containers started from the same image share 100% of the read-only data, while two containers with different images which have layers in common share those common layers. 
  Therefore, you can’t just total the virtual sizes. 
  This over-estimates the total disk usage by a potentially non-trivial amount.

Copy-on-write is a strategy of sharing and copying files for maximum efficiency. 
If a file or directory exists in a lower layer within the image, and another layer (including the writable layer) needs read access to it, 
it just uses the existing file.
