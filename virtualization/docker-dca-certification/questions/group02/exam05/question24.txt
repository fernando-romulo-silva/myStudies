Which of the following is not valid team permission in Docker Trusted Registry?

A)
Read & Write

B)
Manager

C)
Admin

D)
Read only





































Answer B

Permissions are cumulative. 

For example, if you have Write permissions, you automatically have Read permissions:

· Read access allows users to view, search, and pull a private repository in the same way as they can a public repository.

· Write access allows users to push to repositories on Docker Hub.

· Admin access allows users to modify the repositories “Description”, “Collaborators” rights, “Public/Private” visibility, and “Delete”.
