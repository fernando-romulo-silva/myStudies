Which of the following makes it possible to use a registry that is not configured with TLS certificates from a trusted CA?

A)
Pass the '--engine-insecure-registry' flag to the daemon when started.

B)
Set INSECURE_REGISTRY in the '/etc/docker/default' configuration file.

C)
Set and export the IGNORE_TLS environment variable on the command line.

D)
Set IGNORE_TLS in the 'daemon.json' configuration file.





































Answer A

While it’s highly recommended to secure your registry using a TLS certificate issued by a known CA, 
you can choose to use self-signed certificates, or use your registry over an unencrypted HTTP connection. 

Either of these choices involves security trade-offs and additional configuration steps.

This procedure configures Docker to entirely disregard security for your registry.

1. Edit the daemon.json file, whose default location is /etc/docker/daemon.json. Add the following content.
{
  “insecure-registries”: [“myregistrydomain.com:5000”]
}

2. Restart Docker for the changes to take effect.

3. Repeat these steps on every Engine host that wants to access your registry.

Alternatively, you can pass the –engine-insecure-registry flag when the docker engine is started.
