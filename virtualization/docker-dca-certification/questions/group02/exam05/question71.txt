Arrange the steps below in the correct sequence considering a copy-on-write operation; 

A) Any modifications are made to this copy of the file, and the container cannot see the read-only copy of the file that exists in the lower layer.

B) Perform a copy_up operation on the first copy of the file that is found, to copy the file to the container`s writable layer.

C) Search through the image layers for the file to update. 
   The process starts at the newest layer and works down to the base layer one layer at a time. 
   When results are found, they are added to a cache to speed future operations.

Answer B

When an existing file in a container is modified, the storage driver performs a copy-on-write operation. 
The specifics steps involved depend on the specific storage driver. 

For the aufs, overlay, and overlay2 drivers, the copy-on-write operation follows this rough sequence:

· Search through the image layers for the file to update. 
  The process starts at the newest layer and works down to the base layer one layer at a time. 
  When results are found, they are added to a cache to speed future operations.
  
· Perform a copy_up operation on the first copy of the file that is found, to copy the file to the container’s writable layer.

· Any modifications are made to this copy of the file, and the container cannot see the read-only copy of the file that exists in the lower layer.
