To get UCP traffic secured in Docker Swarm mode you need to generate certs externally or set up any CAs manually. 
True or False?

A)
FALSE

B)
TRUE










































Answer A

Control Plane Security

Docker Swarm comes with integrated PKI. 

All managers and nodes in the Swarm have a cryptographically signed identity in the form of a signed certificate. 

All manager-to-manager and manager-to-node control communication is secured out of the box with TLS. 

There is no need to generate certs externally or set up any CAs manually to get end-to-end control plane traffic secured in Docker Swarm mode. 

Certificates are periodically and automatically rotated.
