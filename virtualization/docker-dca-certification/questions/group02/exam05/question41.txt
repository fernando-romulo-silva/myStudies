Which kind of devicemapper should you configure when installing Docker with the intent to run production workloads?

A)
loop-lvm

B)
direct-lvm

C)
aufs-lvm

D)
overlay-lvm





































Answer B

Device Mapper is a kernel-based framework that underpins many advanced volume management technologies on Linux.

Docker’s devicemapper storage driver leverages the thin provisioning and snapshotting capabilities 
of this Device Mapper framework for image and container management.

Device Mapper configuration modes:
· loop-lvm mode – is only appropriate for testing. 
  The loop-lvm mode makes use of a ‘loopback’ mechanism that allows files on the local disk 
  to be read from and written to as if they were an actual physical disk or block device.
  
· direct-lvm mode – Production hosts using the devicemapper storage driver must use direct-lvm 
  mode. This is faster than using loopback devices, uses system resources more efficiently, and block devices can grow as needed. 
  However, more setup is required than in loop-lvm mode.
