If you want to create a container named ‘myweb’ with a volume inside at ‘/my/data/volume’, which command should you use?

A)
docker run -d --name myweb -V /my/data/volume httpd:latest

B)
docker run -d --name myweb -v myvol:/my/data/volume httpd:latest

D)
docker run -d --name myweb --volumes myvol:/my/data/volume httpd:latest

C)
None of the above.





































Answer B

-V and –volumes are incorrect flags.

Output message:
unknown shorthand flag: ‘V’ in -V
unknown flag: –volumes

To mount a volume use -v or –volume.

These flags consist of three fields, separated by colon characters (:). 

The fields must be in the correct order, and the meaning of each field is not immediately obvious:

· In the case of named volumes, the first field is the name of the volume, and is unique on a given host machine. 
  For anonymous volumes, the first field is omitted.

· The second field is the path where the file or directory are mounted in the container.

· The third field is optional, and is a comma-separated list of options, such as ro. These options are discussed below.

If you start a container with a volume that does not yet exist, Docker creates the volume for you. 
The following example mounts the volume myvol2 into /app/ in the container.

$ docker run -d \
  –name devtest \
  -v myvol2:/app \
  nginx:latest
