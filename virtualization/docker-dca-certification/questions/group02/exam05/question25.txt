Which of the following options can you use for publishing and managing trusted collections of content?

A)
DISA

B)
Notary tool

C)
docker secure command

D)
docker trust command





































Answer D

As of Docker Engine 18.06 there is a docker trust command that will streamline the image signing process.

The old is Notary. Notary is a tool for publishing and managing trusted collections of content.

Publishers can digitally sign collections and consumers can verify integrity and origin of content. 
 
This ability is built on a straightforward key management and signing interface to create signed collections and configure trusted publishers.

Use the docker trust inspect to get trust information about an image. 
The following example prints trust information for the alpine:latest image: 
 
$ docker trust inspect alpine:latest


[
  {
    "Name": "alpine:latest",
    "SignedTags": [
      {
        "SignedTag": "latest",
        "Digest": "d6bfc3baf615dc9618209a8d607ba2a8103d9c8a405b3bd8741d88b4bef36478",
        "Signers": [
          "Repo Admin"
        ]
      }
    ],
    "Signers": [],
    "AdministrativeKeys": [
      {
        "Name": "Repository",
        "Keys": [
            {
                "ID": "5a46c9aaa82ff150bb7305a2d17d0c521c2d784246807b2dc611f436a69041fd"
            }
        ]
      },
      {
        "Name": "Root",
        "Keys": [
            {
                "ID": "a2489bcac7a79aa67b19b96c4a3bf0c675ffdf00c6d2fabe1a5df1115e80adce"
            }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
]
