docker trust command





































Answer D

As of Docker Engine 18.06 there is a docker trust command that will streamline the image signing process.

The old is Notary. Notary is a tool for publishing and managing trusted collections of content.

 Publishers can digitally sign collections and consumers can verify integrity and origin of content. 
 
 This ability is built on a straightforward key management and signing interface to create signed collections and configure trusted publishers.
