Answer C

In the context of the Docker registry, garbage collection is the process of removing blobs from the filesystem 
when they are no longer referenced by a manifest. 

Blobs can include both layers and manifests.

Registry data can occupy considerable amounts of disk space. 

In addition, garbage collection can be a security consideration, when it is desirable to ensure that certain layers no longer exist on the filesystem.
