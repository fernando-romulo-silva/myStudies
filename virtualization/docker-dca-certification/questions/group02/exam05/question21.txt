Answer A

A client bundle contains a private and public key pair that authorizes your requests in UCP.

Using client certificate bundle on your local computer, you can use it to authenticate your requests.

What is a client bundle?

A client bundle is a group of certificates downloadable directly from the Docker Universal Control Plane (UCP) 
user interface within the admin section for “My Profile”.

This allows you to authorize a remote Docker engine to a specific user account managed in Docker EE, absorbing all associated RBAC controls in the process. 
You can now execute docker swarm commands from your remote machine that take effect on the remote cluster.
