The devicemapper driver can only use a single block device?

A)
TRUE

B)
FALSE











































Answer B

The devicemapper driver uses block devices dedicated to Docker and operates at the block level, rather than the file level.

With Docker 17.06 and higher, Docker can manage the block device for you, simplifying configuration of direct-lvm mode. 
This is appropriate for fresh Docker setups only.

You can only use a single block device. 
If you need to use multiple block devices, configure direct-lvm mode manually instead.
