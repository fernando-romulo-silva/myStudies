Each container shares the writeable container layer. 
True or false?

A)
TRUE

B)
FALSE










































Answer B

A Docker image is built up from a series of layers. Each layer represents an instruction in the imageâ€™s Dockerfile. 
Each layer except the very last one is read-only.
Each container has its own writable container layer, and all changes are stored in this container layer.
However, multiple containers can share access to the same underlying image and yet have their own data state.
