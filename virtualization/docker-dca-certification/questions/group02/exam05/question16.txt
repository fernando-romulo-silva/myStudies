Which of the following cases requires you to change the docker image layer entirely?

A)
Command under CMD layer creates permission conflicts.

B)
All of the above

C)
File under ADD layer has bad Hex objects.

D)
Components of base image have critical vulnerabilities.





































Answer D

If the vulnerability is in a base layer (such as an operating system) you might not be able to correct the issue in the image, 
since when one base layer needs to be rebuilt, all subsequent layers also need to be rebuilt.

In this case, you might switch to a different version of the base layer, or you might find an equivalent, less vulnerable base layer. 
You might also decide that the vulnerability or exposure is acceptable.
