Answer  D

Collections are groupings of objects within UCP. 

A collection can be made up of one or many of: 

* nodes 

* stacks

* containers 

* services 

* volumes 

* networks 

* secrets

* configs 

* other collections

To associate a node or a stack or any resource with a collection, that resource should share the label com.docker.ucp.access.label with the collection.

A resource can be associated with zero or multiple collections, and a collection can have zero or multiple resources or other child collections in it. 
Collections within collections allow the structuring of resource objects in a hierarchical nature and can significantly simplify access control. 
Access provided at a top level collection is inherited by all its children, including any child collections.
