What is the default period after which a node certificate expires in UCP?

A)
None of the answers is correct

B)
1 year

C)
90 days

D)
24 hours 





































Answer C

Universal Control Planeâ€™s management plane uses a private CA and certificates for all internal communication. 

The client certificates are automatically rotated on a schedule, providing a strong method for reducing the effect of a compromised node. 

There is an option to reduce the default time interval of 90 days to a shorter interval, however shorter intervals do add stress to the UCP cluster. 

To adjust the certificate rotation schedule, go to Admin -> Admin Settings -> Swarm and scroll down.
