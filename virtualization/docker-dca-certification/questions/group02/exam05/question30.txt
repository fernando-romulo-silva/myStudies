Answers B and D

Docker 1.13 introduces the ability to protect the mutual TLS encryption key and the key used to encrypt and decrypt secrets, 
by allowing you to take ownership of these keys and to require manual unlocking of your managers. This feature is called autolock.

When Docker restarts, you must unlock the swarm first, using a key encryption key generated by Docker when the swarm was locked. 

You can rotate this key encryption key at any time.

To enable autolock on an existing swarm, set the autolock flag to true:

$ docker swarm update â€“autolock=true
