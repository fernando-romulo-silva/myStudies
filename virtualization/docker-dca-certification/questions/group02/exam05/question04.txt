You can have a hybrid composition of users backed by an LDAP/AD group plus users set-up manually. 
True or False?

A)
TRUE

B)
FALSE










































Answer B

Subjects are individual users or teams within an organization. 

Teams are typically backed by an LDAP/AD group or search filter. 

It is also possible to add users manually. 

But it is not possible to have a hybrid composition of users. 

In other words, the list of users within a team should be derived from a directory server 
(e.g. AD) or should be added manually, not both.
