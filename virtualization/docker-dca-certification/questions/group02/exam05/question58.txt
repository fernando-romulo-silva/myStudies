Which type of mount is best when you don’t want the data to persist either on the host machine or within the container?

A)
tmpfs

B)
volumes

C)
Regular

D)
bind mounts





































Answer A

As opposed to volumes and bind mounts, a tmpfs mount is temporary, and only persisted in the host memory. 

When the container stops, the tmpfs mount is removed, and files written there won’t be persisted.

This is useful to temporarily store sensitive files that you don’t want to persist in either the host or the container writable layer.
