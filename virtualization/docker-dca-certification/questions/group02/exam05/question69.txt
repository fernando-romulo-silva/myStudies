What happened when a PersistentVolumeClaim canâ€™t be satisfied?

A)
None of the above.

B)
Claim will remain unbound indefinitely

C)
Claim will throw an error when defined

D)
Clain will get as much resources as possible





































Answer B

Claims will remain unbound indefinitely if a matching volume does not exist. 
Claims will be bound as matching volumes become available. 
For example, a cluster provisioned with many 50Gi PVs would not match a PVC requesting 100Gi. 
The PVC can be bound when a 100Gi PV is added to the cluster.
