What happens if you create a Dockerfile and you don’t specify a USER directive?

A)
None of the answers is correct.

B)
By default, the user inside the container created from this Dockerfile is root.

C)
Docker daemon will create a user with the minimum privileadge required to run the container

D)
You will get an error at build time. 





































Answer B

By default the user inside the container is root. 

Using a defense in depth model, it is recommended that not all containers run as root. 

An easy way to mitigate this is to use the –user declaration at run time. 

The container runs as the specified user, essentially removing root access.

Developers should use root as little as possible inside the container. 

Developers should create their app containers with the USER declaration in their Dockerfiles.
