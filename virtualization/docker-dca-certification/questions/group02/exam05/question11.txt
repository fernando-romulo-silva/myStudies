(select all that apply)

A)
auditing

authorization 





































Answers B, C and D

The swarm mode public key infrastructure (PKI) system built into Docker makes it simple to securely deploy a container orchestration system. 

The nodes in a swarm use mutual Transport Layer Security (TLS) to authenticate, authorize, and encrypt the communications with other nodes in the swarm.
