Which type of mount is best when you need to back up, restore, or migrate data from one Docker host to another?

A)
tempfs

B)
Regular

C)
volumes

D)
bind mounts





































Answer C

Volumes are the preferred mechanism for persisting data generated by and used by Docker containers. 
While bind mounts are dependent on the directory structure of the host machine, volumes are completely managed by Docker. 

Volumes have several advantages over bind mounts:

* Volumes are easier to back up or migrate than bind mounts.

* Volumes are useful for backups, restores, and migrations. 
  Use the â€“volumes-from flag to create a new container that mounts that volume.
