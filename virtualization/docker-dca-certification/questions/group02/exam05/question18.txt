Answer D

When communicating over an untrusted medium such as the internet, it is critical to ensure the integrity and the publisher of all the data a system operates on. 

You use the Docker Engine to push and pull images (data) to a public or private registry. 

Content trust gives you the ability to verify both the integrity and the publisher of all the data received from a registry over any channel.

Docker Content Trust (DCT) provides the ability to use digital signatures for data sent to and received from remote Docker registries. 

These signatures allow client-side or runtime verification of the integrity and publisher of specific image tags.
