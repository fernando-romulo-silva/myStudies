You can configure DTR to use your own TLS certificates, 
so that it is automatically trusted by your users’s browser and client tools?

A)
True

B)
False










































Answer A

UCP services include a component called ucp-auth-api, which is the centralized service for identity and authentication used by UCP and DTR.

All UCP services are exposed using HTTPS, to ensure all communications between clients and UCP are encrypted.

By default, this is done using self-signed TLS certificates that are not trusted by client tools like web browsers. 

So when you try to access UCP, your browser warns that it doesn’t trust UCP or that UCP has an invalid certificate. 

The same happens with other client tools.

You can configure UCP to use your own TLS certificates, so that it is automatically trusted by your browser and client tools.
