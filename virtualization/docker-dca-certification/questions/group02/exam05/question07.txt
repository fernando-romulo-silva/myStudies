B)

C)

D)
None of the answers is correct 




































Answer C

Limit Root Access to Node

Docker Enterprise uses a completely separate authentication backend from the host, providing a clear separation of duties. 

Docker Enterprise can leverage an existing LDAP/AD infrastructure for authentication. 

It even utilizes RBAC Labels to control access to objects like images and running containers, 
meaning teams of users can be given full access to running containers. 

With this access, users can watch the logs and execute a shell inside the running container without needing to ever log into the host. 

Limiting the number of users that have access to the host reduces the attack surface.
