Each time a new node joins the swarm, the manager issues a certificate to the node. 
True or False?

A)
FALSE

B)
TRUE










































Answer B

The manager node also generates two tokens to use when you join additional nodes to the swarm: one worker token and one manager token. 

Each token includes the digest of the root CAâ€™s certificate and a randomly generated secret. 

When a node joins the swarm, the joining node uses the digest to validate the root CA certificate from the remote manager. 

The remote manager uses the secret to ensure the joining node is an approved node.

Each time a new node joins the swarm, the manager issues a certificate to the node. 
The certificate contains a randomly generated node ID to identify the node under the certificate common name (CN) and the role under the organizational unit (OU). The node ID serves as the cryptographically secure node identity for the lifetime of the node in the current swarm.

The diagram below illustrates how manager nodes and worker nodes encrypt communications using a minimum of TLS 1.2.
