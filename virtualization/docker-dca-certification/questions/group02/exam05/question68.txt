/var/lib/docker

D)
/var/lib/docker-ce 





































Answer C

The Docker daemon persists all data in a single directory. 
This tracks everything related to Docker, including containers, images, volumes, service definition, and secrets.

By default this directory is:

· /var/lib/docker on Linux.

· C:\ProgramData\docker on Windows.

Usually, on Linux distributions:
"/etc" is used for configurations (.conf files etc). here you find all the configs and settings for your system.

"/var" is usually used for log files, ‘temporary’ files (like mail spool, printer spool, etc), databases, and all other data not tied to a specific user. 
Logs are usually in “/var/log”, databases in “/var/lib” (mysql – “/var/lib/mysql”), etc.
