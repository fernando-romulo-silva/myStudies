When initializing a swarm, what command can you use to specify your own externally-generated root Certificate Authority?

A)
docker int swarm --external-cert

B)
docker int swarm --external-ca

C)
docker swarm init --external-ca

D)
docker swarm init --external-cert





































Answer C

When you create a swarm by running docker swarm init, Docker designates itself as a manager node. 

By default, the manager node generates a new root Certificate Authority (CA) along with a key pair, 
which are used to secure communications with other nodes that join the swarm.

If you prefer, you can specify your own externally-generated root CA, using the â€“external-ca flag of the docker swarm init command.
