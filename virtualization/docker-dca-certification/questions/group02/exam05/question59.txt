Answer B

A user creates, or in the case of dynamic provisioning, has already created, 
a PersistentVolumeClaim with a specific amount of storage requested and with certain access modes. 

A control loop in the master watches for new PVCs, finds a matching PV (if possible), and binds them together. 

If a PV was dynamically provisioned for a new PVC, the loop will always bind that PV to the PVC. 

Otherwise, the user will always get at least what they asked for, but the volume may be in excess of what was requested. 

Once bound, PersistentVolumeClaim binds are exclusive, regardless of how they were bound. 

A PVC to PV binding is a one-to-one mapping, using a ClaimRef which is a bi-directional binding between the PersistentVolume and the PersistentVolumeClaim.
