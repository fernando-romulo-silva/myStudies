Which of the following is not a valid entity in the grant permission model in UCP?

A)
subject

B)
resource sets

C)
role

D)
certificates





































Answer D

You can create by combining subject + role + resource set.

A grant defines who has how much access to what resources. 

Each grant is a 1:1:1 mapping of subject, role, and resource set.

For example, you can grant the “Prod Team” “Restricted Control” over services in the “/Production” collection.
