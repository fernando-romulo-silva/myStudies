Answer C

Anonymous volumes can be cleaned up in two ways. 
First, anonymous volumes are automatically deleted when the container they were created for are automatically cleaned up. 
This happens when containers are deleted via the docker run –rm or docker rm -v flags.
Remove one or more containers:

$ docker rm [OPTIONS] CONTAINER [CONTAINER…]

Second, they can be manually deleted by issuing a docker volume remove command:

$ docker volume rm [OPTIONS] VOLUME [VOLUME…]
