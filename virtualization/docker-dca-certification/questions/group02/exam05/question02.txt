Which of the following could not represent a subject in the RBAC (Role-based access control) model?

A)
user

B)
root

C)
team

D)
organization





































Answer B

A subject represents a user, team, or organization. 
A subject is granted a role for a collection of resources. 
These groups of users are the same across UCP and DTR making RBAC management across the entire software pipeline uniform.

* User – A single user or system account that an authentication backend (AD/LDAP) has validated.

* Team – A group of users that share a set of permissions defined in the team itself. 
A team exists only as part of an organization, and all team members are members of the organization. 
A team can exist in one organization only. 
Assign users to one or more teams and one or more organizations.

* Organization – The largest organizational unit in Docker Enterprise. 
Organizations group together teams to provide broader scope to apply access policy against.
