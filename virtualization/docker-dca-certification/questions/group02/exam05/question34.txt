Which of the following are available security features of Docker Engine? 
(select all that apply)

A)
You can configure Docker`s trust features so that your users can push and pull trusted images

B)
You can use certificate-based client-server authentication to verify a Docker daemon has the rights to access images on a registry

C)
You can configure secure computing mode (Seccomp) policies to secure system calls in a container

D)
You can protect the Docker daemon socket and ensure only trusted Docker client connections 




































Answers A, B, C and D

By default, Docker runs through a non-networked UNIX socket.
It can also optionally communicate using an HTTP socket. 

If you need Docker to be reachable through the network in a safe manner, you can enable TLS by specifying the tlsverify flag
and pointing Docker’s tlscacert flag to a trusted CA certificate.

TLS must be enabled in order to have the Docker client and the daemon communicate securely over HTTPS.

Additionally, TLS ensures authenticity of the registry endpoint and that traffic to/from registry is encrypted.
To ensure the traffic between the Docker registry server and the Docker daemon (a client of the registry server) is encrypted 
and properly authenticated use certificate-based client-server authentication.

In the daemon mode, it only allows connections from clients authenticated by a certificate signed by that CA.
In the client mode, it only connects to servers with a certificate signed by that CA.

Docker Content Trust (DCT) provides the ability to use digital signatures for data sent to and received from remote Docker registries. 
These signatures allow client-side or runtime verification of the integrity and publisher of specific image tags.

* Docker Content Trust Signature Verification *

The Docker Engine can be configured to only run signed images. 

The Docker Content Trust signature verification feature is built directly into the dockerd binary.

This is configured in the Dockerd configuration file.

To enable this feature, trustpinning can be configured in daemon.json, 
whereby only repositories signed with a user-specified root key can be pulled and run.

* seccomp *

Secure computing mode (seccomp) is a Linux kernel feature. 

You can use it to restrict the actions available within the container. 
The seccomp() system call operates on the seccomp state of the calling process. 
You can use this feature to restrict your application’s access.
