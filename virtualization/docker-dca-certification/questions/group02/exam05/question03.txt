Itâ€™s possible to set a secure certificate that is valid for multiple URLs. 
True or False?

A) 
False

B) 
True










































Answer B

Using external certificates is recommended when integrating with a corporate environment. 
Using external, officially-signed certificates simplifies having to distribute internal Certificate Authority (CA) certificates. 

One best practice is to use the Certificate Authority for your organization. 
Reduce the number of certificates by adding multiple Subject Alternative Names (SANs) to a single certificate. 
This allows the certificate to be valid for multiple URLs. 

For example, you can set up a certificate for ucp.example.com, dtr.example.com, and all the underlying hostnames and IP addresses. 
One certificate/key pair makes deploying certs easier.
