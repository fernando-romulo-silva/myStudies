You have created your company’s website with a feature to count the visitors and hosted it using containerized web-servers. 
Which of the following provisions can potentially make you lose the track of your visitor count?

A)
volumes

B)
tmpfs

C)
bind mounts

D)
all of the above




































Answer B

Volumes and bind mounts let you share files between the host machine and container so that you can persist data even after the container is stopped.

However, if you’re running Docker on Linux, you have a third option: tmpfs mounts.

As opposed to volumes and bind mounts, a tmpfs mount is temporary, and only persisted in the host memory. 
When the container stops, the tmpfs mount is removed, and files written there won’t be persisted.

Therefore, this kind of mount is not recommended for storing state such as the visitor counts.
