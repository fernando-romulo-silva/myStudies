Which of the following commands can be used to reduce the surface of attack from a container?

A)
--cap-add=ALL
 
B) 
--cap-add

C)
None of the answers is correct.

D)
--cap-drop 





































Answer D

Linux capabilities are an even more granular way of reducing surface area. 

Docker Engine has a default list of capabilities that are kept for newly-created containers, and by using the –cap-drop option for docker run, 
users can exclude additional capabilities from being used by processes inside the container on a capability-by-capability basis. 

All privileges can be dropped with the –user option.

Likewise, capabilities that are, by default, not granted to new containers can be added with the –cap-add option. 

This is discouraged unless absolutely necessary, and using –cap-add=ALL is highly discouraged.

Limiting the capabilities of a container reduces the attack surface.
