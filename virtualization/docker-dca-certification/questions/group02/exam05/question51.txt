Which of the following commands will automatically create a volume when a container is run?

A)
docker container run --name nginxtest -v /app:mount nginx

B)

C)
docker container run --name nginxtest -v myvol:/app nginx

D)
docker container run --name nginxtest --volumes=/app nginx





































Answer C

To mount a volume use -v or –volume.

These flags consist of three fields, separated by colon characters (:). 
The fields must be in the correct order, and the meaning of each field is not immediately obvious.

· In the case of named volumes, the first field is the name of the volume, and is unique on a given host machine. 
  For anonymous volumes, the first field is omitted.
  
· The second field is the path where the file or directory are mounted in the container.

· The third field is optional, and is a comma-separated list of options, such as ro. 
  These options are discussed below.

If you start a container with a volume that does not yet exist, 
Docker creates the volume for you. 
The following example mounts the volume myvol2 into /app/ in the container.

$ docker run -d \
  –name devtest \
  -v myvol2:/app \
  nginx:latest
