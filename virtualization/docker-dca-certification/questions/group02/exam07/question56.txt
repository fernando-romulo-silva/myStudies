Exit Status
The exit code from docker run gives information about why the container failed to run or why it exited. 
When docker run exits with a non-zero code, the exit codes follow the chroot standard, see below:

125 if the error is with Docker daemon itself

126 if the contained command cannot be invoked

127 if the contained command cannot be found
