Task is a unidirectional mechanism. 
True or False?

A)
TRUE

B)
FALSE 










































Answer A

A task is a one-directional mechanism.

This means that it progresses monotonically through a series of states: assigned, prepared, running, etc. 

If the task fails the orchestrator removes the task and its container and then creates a new task to replace 
it according to the desired state specified by the service.
