Which of the following Dockerfile instructions confirms Docker’s core concepts of source control and cheap commits?

A)
RUN

B) 
CMD

C) 
ARG

Answer A

Layering RUN instructions and generating commits conforms to the core concepts 
of Docker where commits are cheap and containers can be created from any point 
in an image’s history, much like source control.
