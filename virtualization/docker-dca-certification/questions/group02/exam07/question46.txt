Which of the following network drivers connects the container's network stack directly to Docker Host?

A)
overlay

B)
bridge

C) 
host

D)
macvlan





































Answer C

If you use the host network mode for a container, that container’s network stack is not isolated from the Docker host 
(the container shares the host’s networking namespace), and the container does not get its own IP-address allocated. 

For instance, if you run a container which binds to port 80 and you use host networking, 
the container’s application is available on port 80 on the host’s IP address.
