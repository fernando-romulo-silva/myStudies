In order to configure Docker daemon to start as the system boots up, which of the following commands is correct for most Linux distributions?

A)
sudo systemctl up docker

B)
sudo systemctl enable docker

C)
sudo systemctl start docker

D)
sudo systemctl default docker





































Answer B

Most of the current Linux distributions use “systemd” to manage which services to start when the system boots up. 
“enable” will mark a particular service to start when the system boots, whereas “start” will immediately start the particular service.
