D)

Answer A

The container named “web-server” will run as a background process (-d), with its STDIN open (-i), and will have a pseudo-TTY (-t). 
The “-p” flag will make sure that localhost’s port 8080 is mapped with container’s port 80. 
And at last, mention the name of the official nginx web-server Docker Image and run the command.
