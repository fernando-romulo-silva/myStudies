Which of the following Dockerfile instructions informs Docker about the port on which container is listening? 

A)
EXPOSE

B) 
ENV

C) 
PORT

D) 
LABEL





































Answer A  

The EXPOSE instruction informs Docker that the container listens on the specified network ports at runtime. 
You can specify whether the port listens on TCP or UDP, and the default is TCP if the protocol is not specified.

The EXPOSE instruction does not actually publish the port. 
It functions as a type of documentation between the person who builds the image and the person who runs the container, 
about which ports are intended to be published.
