Answer C

The docker cp utility copies the contents of SRC_PATH to the DEST_PATH. 
You can copy from the containerâ€™s file system to the local machine or the reverse, from the local filesystem to the container. 

If - is specified for either the SRC_PATH or DEST_PATH, you can also stream a tar archive from STDIN or to STDOUT. 

The CONTAINER can be a running or stopped container. 
The SRC_PATH or DEST_PATH can be a file or directory.
