What is the final outcome of a container created from the following Dockerfile? 

FROM ubutu:trusty
RUN apt-get update -y
ENTRYPOINT [“/bin/ping”,”-c”,”6″] 
CMD [“localhost”]

A)
Container will ping localhost for 6 times and will return to its shell.

B)
Container will remain in created state.

C)
Container will ping the localhost for 6 times and will stop running.

D)
Container will get stuck in infinite pinging loop.
































Answer C

Here, the container should run as executable to ping the localhost exactly 6 times. 

For that, ENTRYPOINT instruction is defined in exec form with “/bin/ping” path as an executable. 

We have two parameters for this executable: -c flag and decimal count 6. 

It means the ping operation will be performed exactly 6 times by the container. 

CMD will provide the default arguments (in this case “localhost”) for the executable in ENTRYPOINT instruction. 

After pinging the localhost for 6 times, the container will gracefully stop as the CMD and ENTRYPOINT instructions have been successfully performed.
