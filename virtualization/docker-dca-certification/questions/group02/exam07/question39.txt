Which docker network is used to connect one or more docker daemons of participating nodes in swarm cluster?

A)
bridge

B)
ingress

C)
docker_gwbridge

D) 
overlay





































Answer C

The docker_gwbridge is a virtual bridge that connects the overlay networks (including the ingress network) 
to an individual Docker daemonâ€™s physical network. Docker creates it automatically when you initialize a swarm or join a Docker host to a swarm, 
but it is not a Docker device.
