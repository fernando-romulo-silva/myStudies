Which of the following is NOT a part of the grant permission in UCP?

A)
role

B)
subject

C)
resource sets

D)
certificates





































Answer D

You can create by combining subject + role + resource set.

A grant defines who has how much access to what resources. 

Each grant is a 1:1:1 mapping of subject, role, and resource set.

For example, you can grant the “Prod Team” “Restricted Control” over services in the “/Production” collection.
