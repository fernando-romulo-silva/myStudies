You have created your company’s website with visitor counts and hosted it using containerized web-servers. 
Which of the following provisions can potentially make you lose the track of your visitor count?

A)
tmpfs

B) 
bind mounts

C) 
volumes

D) 
all of the above




































Answer A

tmpfs mount is temporary, and only persists in the host memory. 
When the container stops, the tmpfs mount is removed, and files written there won’t be persisted.
