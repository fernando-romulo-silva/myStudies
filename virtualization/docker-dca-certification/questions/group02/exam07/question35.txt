Answer B
   
The Container Network Model (CNM) is a specification proposed by Docker.

Network Sandbox: Essentially the networking stack within a container, it is an isolated environment to contain a containerâ€™s network configuration.

Endpoint: A network interface that typically comes in pairs. 
One end of the pair sits in the network sandbox, while the other sits in a designated network. 
Endpoints join exactly one network, and multiple endpoints can exist within a single network sandbox.

Network: A group of endpoints. A network is a uniquely identifiable group of endpoints that can communicate with each other.
