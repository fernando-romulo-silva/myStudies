After pressing the key sequence CTRL+C, which of the following signals is sent to stop a running container?

A)
SIGTERM

B)
SIGINT

C)
SIGKILL

D)
COPY





































Answer C

To stop a container, use CTRL-c. This key sequence sends SIGKILL to the container. 
If --sig-proxy is true (the default),CTRL-c sends a SIGINT to the container. 
If the container was run with -i and -t, you can detach from a container and leave it running using the CTRL-p CTRL-q key sequence.
