Which of the following is NOT true about Raft (docker consensus algorithm)?

A)
If a quorum is not reached, the system will not process any more requests to schedule additional tasks

B)
Raft requires a majority or quorum of (N/2) + 1 members

C)
Raft tolerates up to (N-2)/2 failures

D)
If a quorum is not reached, the existing tasks will keep running





































Answer C

When the Docker Engine runs in swarm mode, manager nodes implement the Raft Consensus Algorithm to manage the global cluster state.

Raft requires a majority of managers, also called the quorum, to agree on proposed updates to the swarm, such as node additions or removals. 

If the swarm loses the quorum of managers, the swarm cannot perform administrative tasks such as scaling or updating services and joining or removing nodes from the swarm.

Nevertheless, tasks on existing worker nodes continue to run.

Raft tolerates UP TO (N â€“ 1)/2 failures and requires a majority or quorum of (N/2) + 1 members to agree on values proposed to the cluster.
