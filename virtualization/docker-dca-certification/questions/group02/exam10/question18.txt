Answers C and D

When processes outside Docker depend on Docker containers, you can use a process manager such as upstart and systemd

systemd is a software suite that provides an array of system components for Linux[6] operating systems. 
Its main aim is to unify service configuration and behavior across Linux distributions;
systemd's primary component is a "system and service manager"—an init system used to bootstrap user space and manage user processes. 


Upstart was an event-based replacement for the traditional init daemon—the method by which several Unix-like computer operating systems 
perform tasks when the computer is started.

Ubuntu moved away from Upstart with the release of version 15.04 (Vivid Vervet) in favor of migrating to systemd.
