and marks it as holding externally mounted volumes from native host or other containers?

A)

B)

VOLUME

D)

Answer C

VOLUME [“/data”]

The VOLUME instruction creates a mount point with the specified name and marks it as holding externally mounted volumes from native host or other containers. 

The value can be a JSON array, VOLUME [“/var/log/”], or a plain string with multiple arguments, such as VOLUME /var/log or VOLUME /var/log /var/db.
