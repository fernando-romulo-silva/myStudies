Which network driver type is best when you need multiple containers to communicate on the same Docker host?

A)
Host networks

B)
Overlay networks

C)
User-defined bridge networks

D)
Macvlan networks 





































Answer C

Network driver type

Dockerâ€™s networking subsystem is pluggable, using drivers.

bridge - networks are best when you need multiple containers to communicate on the same Docker host.

Host networks - are best when the network stack should not be isolated from the Docker host, but you want other aspects of the container to be isolated.

Overlay -  networks are best when you need containers running on different Docker hosts to communicate, or when multiple applications work together using swarm services.

Macvlan -  networks are best when you are migrating from a VM setup or need your containers to look like physical hosts on your network, each with a unique MAC address.

Third-party network plugins- allow you to integrate Docker with specialized network stacks.
