What is the difference between a replicated and a global service?

A)
Replicated service can only be deployed on manager node. 
Global service can be deployed on both manager and worker node.

B)
Number of identical tasks can be specified for a replicated service. 
There is no pre-specified number of tasks for global service.

C)
Replicated service runs one task on every node. Global service runs multiple task on every node.

D)
Good candidates for replicated service are monitoring agents that you want to run on every node in the swarm. 
Good candidates for global service are http servers.


































Answer B

There are two types of service deployments, replicated and global.

For a replicated service, you specify the number of identical tasks you want to run. 
For example, you decide to deploy an HTTP service with three replicas, each serving the same content.

A global service is a service that runs one task on every node.
There is no pre-specified number of tasks. 
Each time you add a node to the swarm, the orchestrator creates a task and the scheduler assigns the task to the new node.
