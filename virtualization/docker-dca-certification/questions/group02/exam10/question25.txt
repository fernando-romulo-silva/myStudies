What is the docker command to create a bridge network?

A) 
docker network deploy

B) 
docker network create

C)
docker create network

D)
docker network add





































Answer B

To create a new network use:
$ docker network create [OPTIONS] NETWORK

For example:

$ docker network create -d bridge my-bridge-network

The DRIVER accepts bridge or overlay which are the built-in network drivers. 
If you have installed a third party or your own custom network driver you can specify that DRIVER here also. 
If you don’t specify the –driver option, the command automatically creates a bridge network for you.
