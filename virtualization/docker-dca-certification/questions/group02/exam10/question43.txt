A host machine has four CPUs available and two running containers. 
The sysadmin would like to assign two CPUs to each container. 
Which of the following commands achieves this?

A)
Set the '--cpuset-cpus' flag of the 'dockerd' process to the value 'even-spread'

B)
Set the '--cpu-quota' flag to '1.3' on one container and '2,4' on the other container.

C)
Set the '--cpus' flag to '.5' on both containers

D)
Set the '--cpuset-cpu's flag to '1.3' on one container and '2.4' on the other container.



































Answer C

--cpus

Specify how much of the available CPU resources a container can use. 

The value '.5' is 50% of the all cores.
