Choice of storage mount options can affect the representation of data in the container.

A)
TRUE

B)
FALSE 











































Answer B

Data within the container is exposed as either directory or individual files in container’s FS. 

So, the type of storage mount (volume, bind or tmpfs) does not have any control on data’s representation. 

To differentiate among the storage mounts: volume, bind mount, and tmpfs, user need to check the location where these mounts store container’s data on host system.
