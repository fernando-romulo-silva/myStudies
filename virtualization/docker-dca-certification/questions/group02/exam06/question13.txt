Which of the following is the functionality of a storage driver?

B)

C)

D)
All of the above.

Docker uses storage drivers to store image layers, and to store data in the writable layer of a container. 
The containerâ€™s writable layer does not persist after the container is deleted, but is suitable for storing ephemeral data that is generated at runtime.
