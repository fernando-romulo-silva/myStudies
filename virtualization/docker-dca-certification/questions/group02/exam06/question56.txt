What is the default network for swarm services?

A)
bridge

B)  
host

C) 
ingress

D) 
none





































Answer C

When you initialize a swarm or join a Docker host to an existing swarm, two new networks are created on that Docker host:

* an overlay network called ingress, which handles the control and data traffic related to swarm services. 
When you create a swarm service and do not connect it to a user-defined overlay network, it connects to the ingress network by default.
