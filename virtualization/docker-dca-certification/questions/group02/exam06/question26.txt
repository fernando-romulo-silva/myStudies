Which of the following networks removes the network isolation between container and docker host?

A)
ingress

B)
bridge

C)
host

D)
macvlan





































Answer C

If you use the host network mode for a container, that container’s network stack is not isolated from the Docker host 
(the container shares the host’s networking namespace), and the container does not get its own IP-address allocated.
