Which of the following commands is used to backup Docker containers?

A)
docker save

B)
docker export

C)
docker tar -cvf

D)
None of the above





































Answer B

docker export command exports a CONTAINERâ€™s filesystem as a tar archive. 

The docker export command does not export the contents of volumes associated with the container. 
If a volume is mounted on top of an existing directory in the container, docker export will export the contents of the underlying directory, 
not the contents of the volume.

$ docker export red_panda > latest.tar
