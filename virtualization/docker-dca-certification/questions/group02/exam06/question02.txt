Which of the following mechanisms tries to place services evenly on appropriate nodes in a swarm cluster?

A)
Placement Constraint

B)
Placement Preference

C)
Replicated Mode

D)
Routing Mesh





































Answer B

Placement Preference evenly distributes services based on the label value of the nodes. 

If user has set a label value “default” for some nodes in cluster, then user can set a placement preference to spread the service evenly across those nodes who have “default” label value.
