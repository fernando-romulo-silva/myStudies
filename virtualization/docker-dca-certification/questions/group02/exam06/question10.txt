You have a 35 nodes swarm cluster. 
Out of which, 11 nodes are manager nodes. 
In order to avoid failure of set of machines or to perform periodic maintenance tasks, 
Which one of the following is the optimal distribution of manager nodes?

A)
6/4/1

B)
5/5/1

C)
5/2/4

D)
4/4/3


































Answer D

Manager nodes are distributed across a minimum of 3 availability-zones to support failures of machines and to support periodic maintenance tasks. 
Start distributing one manager node at a time in each zone until you are left with 0 manager nodes.
