Which of the following Dockerfile instructions is used to provide defaults for an executing container?

A)
CMD

B)
ENTRYPOINT

C)
ENV

D)
FROM





































Answer A

The main purpose of a CMD is to provide defaults for an executing container. 
These defaults can include an executable, or they can omit the executable, in which case you must specify an ENTRYPOINT instruction as well.

If CMD is used to provide default arguments for the ENTRYPOINT instruction, 
both the CMD and ENTRYPOINT instructions should be specified with the JSON array format.

An ENTRYPOINT allows you to configure a container that will run as an executable.
