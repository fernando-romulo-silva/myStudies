Which processâ€™s output will be available on terminal as standard output as a result of docker attach command?

A)
RUN

B) 
ENTRYPOINT/CMD

C) 
EXPOSE

D)
FROM





































Answer B

The attach command will display the output of the ENTRYPOINT/CMD process. 

This can appear as if the attach command is hung when in fact the process may simply not be interacting with the terminal at that time.
