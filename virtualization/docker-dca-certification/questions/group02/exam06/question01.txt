You have been assigned a task to host your organization’s event blog using WordPress and MySQL database on a 25 active nodes swarm cluster. 
Make sure that one task of MySQL database service is deployed on each active node in swarm cluster. 
Which of the following commands will achieve your purpose? 

A)
docker service create --name mySQL --global mysql docker service create --name wordpress --replicas=25 wordpress ?

B)
docker service create --name mySQL --mode global mysql docker service create --name wordpress --replicas=25 wordpress

C)
docker service create --name mySQL --config global mysql docker service create --name wordpress --replicas=25 wordpress

D)
None of the above  



































Answer B

For replicated services, user need to specify the number of replica tasks for the swarm manager to schedule onto active nodes in cluster. 

Whereas, in case of global service, scheduler places one task of service on each active node of the cluster. 

As asked in this question, to deploy one task of MySQL service on each active node, 
we need to deploy mysql service as “global service” by setting the service mode to “–mode global”.
