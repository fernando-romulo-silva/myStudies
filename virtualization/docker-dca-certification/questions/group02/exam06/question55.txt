You have a swarm cluster which consists of 27 active nodes. 
Out of which, 9 nodes are managers and one node is the leader. 
What will be the fault tolerance and quorum of this swarm cluster respectively? 

A)
14, 13

B)
4, 5

C)
13, 14

D)
5, 4



































Answer B

The fault tolerance equation is (N-1)/2 and quorum equation is (N/2)+1 where N = total number of manager nodes in swarm cluster

Tolerance Equation: (9-1)/2 = 4

Quorum Equation: (9/2) + 1 = 5
