Which of the following commands is used to connect the network to running container?

A)
docker connect

B)
docker network join

C)
docker network connect

D)
None of the above





































Answer C is correct

When you create a new container, you can specify one or more --network flags. 
This example connects a Nginx container to the my-net network.

$ docker create --name my-nginx \
  --network my-net \
  --publish 8080:80 \
  nginx:latest
  

To connect a running container to an existing user-defined bridge, use the docker network connect command. 
The following command connects an already-running my-nginx container to an already-existing my-net network:

$ docker network connect my-net my-nginx
