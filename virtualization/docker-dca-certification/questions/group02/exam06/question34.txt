Which of the following instructions sets the base image for subsequent instructions in Dockerfile?

A)
CMD

B)
FROM

C)
ARG

D)

Answer B

The FROM instruction specifies the Parent Image from which you are building. 

FROM may only be preceded by one or more ARG instructions, which declare arguments that are used in FROM lines in the Dockerfile.

Dockerfile example:

FROM eclipse-temurin:17.0.1_12-jre-alpine
WORKDIR /application
