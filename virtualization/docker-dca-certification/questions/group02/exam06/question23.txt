Answer C 

Docker Universal Control Plane (UCP) is an enterprise on-premise solution that enables IT operations 
teams to deploy and manage their Dockerized applications in production, while giving developers the agility 
and portability they need, all from within the enterprise firewall.

Docker UCP has the ability to create teams and orgs and granular RBAC (Role-based access control) policies to managed objects like containers.
