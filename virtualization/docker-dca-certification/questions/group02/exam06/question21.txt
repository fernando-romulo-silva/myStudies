Answer B

To sign a Docker Image you will need a delegation key pair. 
These keys can be generated locally using 

$ docker trust key generate 

or generated by a certificate authority.

$ export DOCKER_CONTENT_TRUST=1

And

$ docker push registry.example.com/admin/demo:1

/demo:1
Signing and pushing trust data for local image registry.example.com/admin/demo:1, may overwrite remote trust data
The push refers to repository [registry.example.com/admin/demo]
