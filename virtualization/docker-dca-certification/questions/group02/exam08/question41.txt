Answer A

By default, a container inherits the DNS settings of the host, as defined in the /etc/resolv.conf configuration file. 

Containers that use the default bridge network get a copy of this file, whereas containers that use a custom network use Dockerâ€™s embedded DNS server, 
which forwards external DNS lookups to the DNS servers configured on the host.
