Which of the following is the default mount point for a decrypted secret in a Windows container?

A)
C:\ProgramData\Docker\secrets

B)
C:\Users\Docker\secrets

C)
C:\Docker\secrets

D)
C:\Users\internal\Docker\secrets 








































Answer A

Since Windows does not support non-directory file bind-mounts. 
Instead, secrets for a container are all mounted in C:\ProgramData\Docker\internal\secrets within the container. 
Symbolic links are used to point from there to the desired target of the secret within the container
