Is it possible to join a new node to a swarm cluster after removing Universal Control Plane from the cluster?

A)
Yes, you can go to swarm manager terminal and use docker swarm join command.

B)
No, because UCPâ€™s removal blocks any other access to swarm cluster.

C)
Yes, you can reinstall UCP on the cluster and then join the node.

D)
No, because the cluster will be unstable for any new process initialization.





































Answer C

Once the uninstall command finishes, UCP is completely removed from all the nodes in the cluster. 
You don't need to run the command again from other nodes.

If you wish to remove a single node from the UCP cluster, you should instead Remove that node from the cluster.
