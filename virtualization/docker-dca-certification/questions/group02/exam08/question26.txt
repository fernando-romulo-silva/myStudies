Which of the following endpoints exposed by DTR is used to monitor the health of DTR replicas?

A)
/_ping

B)
/_connect

C)
/_staus

D)
/_healthcheck





































Answer A
 
So, you can use HEALTCHECK CMD curl --fail http://localhost/health || exit 1 to check the health

Docker Trusted Registry is a Dockerized application. 
To monitor it, you can use the same tools and techniques youâ€™re already using to monitor other containerized applications running on your cluster. 
One way to monitor DTR is using the monitoring capabilities of Docker Universal Control Plane.

DTR also exposes several endpoints you can use to assess if a DTR replica is healthy or not:

/_ping: Checks if the DTR replica is healthy, and returns a simple json response. 
This is useful for load balancing or other automated health check tasks.

/nginx_status: Returns the number of connections being handled by the NGINX front-end used by DTR.

/api/v0/meta/cluster_status: Returns extensive information about all DTR replicas.
