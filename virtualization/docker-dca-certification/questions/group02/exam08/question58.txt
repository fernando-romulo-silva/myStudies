Given below is a tiny Dockerfile based on the “scratch” image. 
If we build a docker image based on this Dockerfile, what will be the first filesystem layer of that docker image?

FROM scratch
ADD hello /
CMD [“/hello”]

A)
scratch

B)
baserc

C)
ADD

D)
CMD 
































Answer C 

Using the scratch “image” signals to the build process that you want the NEXT command in the Dockerfile to be the first filesystem layer in your image.
