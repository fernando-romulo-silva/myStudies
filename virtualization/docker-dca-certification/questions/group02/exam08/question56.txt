Which of the following in Docker content trust provides control over the image tag signing process?

A)
Root certificates

B)
Delegations

C)
Docker Daemon

D)
Docker Client 





































Answer B

Delegations in Docker Content Trust (DCT) allow you to control who can and cannot sign an image tag. 

A delegation will have a pair of private and public delegation keys. 

A delegation could contain multiple pairs of keys and contributors in order to:
 
  a) allow multiple users to be part of a delegation, and 
  b) to support key rotation.
