Which of the following is the core component of the Universal Control Plane?

A)
ucp-controller

B)
ucp-manager

ucp-worker

ucp-agent

When you deploy UCP, it starts running a globally scheduled service called ucp-agent. 
This service monitors the node where itâ€™s running and starts and stops UCP services, based on whether the node is a manager or a worker node.
