There is a DTR cluster running 6 DTR replicas. 
Out of which, 1 replica is behaving a bit odd than its desired state. 
You have been assigned the task to determine whether this cluster is healthy or not. 
Out of the following options, what will be your verdict?

A)
Cluster is unhealthy because the majority of replicas are not working properly.

B)
Cluster is healthy but it has lost its quorum.

C)
Cluster is healthy because the majority of replicas are working fine.

D)
Cluster is unhealthy because one replica is not working properly.


































Answer C

When one or more DTR replicas are unhealthy but the overall majority (n/2 + 1) is healthy and able to communicate with one another, 
your DTR cluster is still functional and healthy.
