Which of the following flags is used to change the containerâ€™s default hostname?


A)
--name

B)
--ip

C)
--hostname

D)
--rename




































Answer C

The --hostname flag only changes the hostname inside your container.

This may be needed if your application expects a specific value for the hostname.
 
It does not change DNS outside of docker, nor does it change the networking isolation, 
so it will not allow others to connect to the container with that name.

$ docker run --hostname test --ip 10.1.2.3 ubuntu:14.04
