Which of the following keys is not a Docker Trusted Content key?

A)
tagging keys

B)
offline keys

C)
server-managed keys

D)
CA keys





































Answer D

Trust for an image tag is managed through the use of signing keys. 
A key set is created when an operation using DCT is first invoked. 
A key set consists of the following classes of keys:

* an offline key that is the root of DCT for an image tag

* repository or tagging keys that sign tags

* server-managed keys such as the timestamp key, which provides freshness security guarantees for your repository
