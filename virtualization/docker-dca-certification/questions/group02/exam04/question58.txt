Which of the following options is best to enable developers to read logs?

A)
Grant them SSH access to the host server to read the logs directly.

B)
Enable centralized and remote logging using syslog.

C)
None of the answers is correct.

D)
Allow access only via docker logs.





































Answer B

Having a central location for all Engine and container logs is recommended. 
This provides “off-node” access to all the logs, empowering developers without having to grant them SSH access.
To enable centralized logging, modify /etc/docker/daemon.json and add the following:

{
  “log-level”: “syslog”,
  “log-opts”: {syslog-address=tcp://192.x.x.x}
}

Then restart the daemon:

$ sudo systemctl restart docker
