Containers on user-defined bridge network can communicate only via IP addresses. 
True or False?

A)
FALSE

B)
TRUE










































Answer A

Using a user-defined network provides a scoped network in which only containers attached to that network are able to communicate.

Furthermore, on user-defined networks, containers can not only communicate by IP address, 
but can also resolve a container name to an IP address. 

This capability is called automatic service discovery. 

However, containers connected to the default bridge network can communicate, but only by IP address, 
unless they are linked using the legacy –link flag.

Obs. If you do not specify a network using the –network flag, and you do specify a network driver, 
your container is connected to the default bridge network by default.
