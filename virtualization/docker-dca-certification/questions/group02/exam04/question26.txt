Which address pool is used by Docker Swarm by default?

A)
10.0.0.0/16

B)
192.168.0.0/16

C)
172.16.0.0/12

D)
10.0.0.0/8





































Answer D

By default, Docker Swarm uses a default address pool 10.0.0.0/8 for global scope (overlay) networks.
Every network that does not have a subnet specified will have a subnet sequentially allocated from this pool. 
In some circumstances it may be desirable to use a different default IP address pool for networks.

For example, if the default 10.0.0.0/8 range conflicts with already allocated address space in your network, 
then it is desirable to ensure that networks use a different range without requiring Swarm users to specify each subnet with the â€“subnet command.
