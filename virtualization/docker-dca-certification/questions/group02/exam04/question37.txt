C)
local

D)
service





































Answer B

Docker network drivers have a concept of scope. 
The network scope is the domain of the driver which can be the local or swarm scope.

* Local scope drivers provide connectivity and network services (such as DNS or IPAM) within the scope of the host.

* Swarm scope drivers provide connectivity and network services across a swarm cluster. 
  Swarm scope networks have the same network ID across the entire cluster while local scope networks have a unique network ID on each host.
