What should you do in the event that a cluster CA key or a manager node is compromised?

A)
Remove the swarm root CA

B)
Remove the node

C)
Generate the swarm root CA

D)
Rotate the swarm root CA





































Answer D

Rotating the CA certificate

In the event that a cluster CA key or a manager node is compromised, you can rotate the swarm root CA so that none of 
the nodes trust certificates signed by the old root CA anymore.

Run docker swarm ca –rotate to generate a new CA certificate and key. 
If you prefer, you can pass the –ca-cert and –external-ca flags to specify the root certificate and to use a root CA external to the swarm. 
Alternately, you can pass the –ca-cert and –ca-key flags to specify the exact certificate and key you would like the swarm to use.
