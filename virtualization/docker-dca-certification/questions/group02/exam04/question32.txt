A)
LoadBalancer

B)
NodePort

C)
ClusterIP

D)
Ingress





































Answer C

Services will receive a cluster-scoped Virtual IP address also known as ClusterIP.

ClusterIP is the default method of exposing the service internally. 

Once the service is created and a VIP is associated with it, every kube-proxy running on every cluster node 
will program an iptables rule so that all traffic destined to that VIP will be redirected to one of the Service’s backend pods instead.

If the service needs to be accessed from outside the cluster, 
then there are a couple of available options to doing so. Mainly NodePort and LoadBalancer.

Ingress is another method that you can use. 
Ingress is technically not a Type of a service, but it’s another method for using Layer 7 based routing to expose your services externally.
