Answer C

$ docker network ls [OPTIONS]

Lists all the networks the Engine daemon knows about. 

This includes the networks that span across multiple hosts in a cluster.

Example:

$ docker network ls
NETWORK ID     NAME      DRIVER    SCOPE
2971d20fddb3   bridge    bridge    local
39da35b4aa45   host      host      local
087d59c10fe3   none      null      local
