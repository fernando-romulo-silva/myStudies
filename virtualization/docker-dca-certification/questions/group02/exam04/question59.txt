Ops client bundels and dev client bundles.

B)
Docker CLI bundles and Docker web UI bundles.

C)
Docker UCP Client bundles and DTR client bundles.

D)
Admin user certificate bundles and user certificate bundles.





































Answer D

A client bundle contains a private and public key pair that authorizes your requests in UCP. 
In order to authenticate your requests, you can download client certificate bundle to your local computer.

UCP issues different types of certificates depending on the user:

· User certificate bundles: only allow running docker commands through a UCP manager node.

· Admin user certificate bundles: allow running docker commands on the Docker Engine of any node.
