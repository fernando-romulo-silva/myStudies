When you start manually the docker daemon you see an error like the one below. 
What should you do?

unable to configure the Docker daemon with file /etc/docker/daemon.json: 
the following directives are specified both as a flag and in the configuration file: 
hosts: (from flag: [unix:///var/run/docker.sock], from file: [tcp://127.0.0.1:2376])

A)
Adjust the flags you're using to start the daemon or modify the daemon.json to remove the conflict

B)
Ensure the host is accessible on the network and try again

C)
Restart your host to resolve the conflict

D)
Verify that port 2376 is open 
































Answer A

Troubleshoot conflicts between the daemon.json and startup scripts

If you use a daemon.json file and also pass options to the dockerd command manually or using start-up scripts, 
and these options conflict, Docker fails to start with an error such as:

unable to configure the Docker daemon with file /etc/docker/daemon.json:
the following directives are specified both as a flag and in the configuration
file: hosts: (from flag: [unix:///var/run/docker.sock], from file: [tcp://127.0.0.1:2376])

If you see an error similar to this one and you are starting the daemon manually with flags, you may need to adjust 
your flags or the daemon.json to remove the conflict.
