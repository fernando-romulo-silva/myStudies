Which of the following components can you use to create users and teams?

A)
Docker Trusted Registry

B)
Docker Machine

C)
Universal Control Plane

D)
Docker Compose





































Answer C

UCP has role-based access control (RBAC), so that you can control who can access and make changes to your cluster and applications.

Using the UI for Docker Enterprise of Docker Universal Control Plane (UCP), you authorize users to view, edit, 
and use cluster resources by granting role-based permissions against resource sets.

To authorize access to cluster resources across your organization, UCP administrators might take the following high-level steps:

路 Add and configure subjects (users, teams, and service accounts).

路 Define custom roles (or use defaults) by adding permitted operations per type of resource.

路 Group cluster resources into resource sets of Swarm collections or Kubernetes namespaces.

路 Create grants by combining subject + role + resource set.
