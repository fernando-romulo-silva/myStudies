Which of the following network construct aim to provide isolation for a container?

A)
IPAM Driver

B)
Endpoint

C)
Routing mesh

D)
Sandbox





































Answer D

The sandbox perfectly isolates a container from the outside world. 
No inbound network connection is allowed into the sandboxed container. 

Yet, it is very unlikely that a container will be of any value in a system if absolutely no communication with it is possible. 
To work around this, we have element number two, which is the endpoint.
An endpoint is a controlled gateway from the outside world into the network’s sandbox that shields the container. 

The endpoint connects the network sandbox, but not the container, to the third element of the model, which is the network. 
Also, the Endpoint construct exists so the actual connection to the network can be abstracted away from the application. 
This helps maintain portability so that a service can use different types of network drivers without being concerned with how it’s connected to that network.
