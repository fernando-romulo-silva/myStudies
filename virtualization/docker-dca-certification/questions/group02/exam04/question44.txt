In Docker swarm, traffic can be routed to services based on hostname. 
True or false?

A)
TRUE

B)
FALSE










































Answer A

The swarm mode routing mesh is great for transport-layer routing. 
It routes to services using the service’s published ports.

However, if you want to route traffic to services based on hostname instead you have to use the “Swarm Layer 7 Routing (Interlock)”.

This is a feature that enables service discovery on the application layer (L7). 
This Layer 7 Routing extends upon the swarm mode routing mesh by adding application layer capabilities such as inspecting the HTTP header.

The Interlock Proxy works by using the HTTP/1.1 header field definition. Every HTTP/1.1 TCP request contains a Host: header.
