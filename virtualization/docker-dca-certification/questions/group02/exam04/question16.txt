Answer D

IPAM Drivers â€” Docker has a native IP Address Management Driver that provides default subnets or 
IP addresses for the networks and endpoints if they are not specified. 

IP addressing can also be manually assigned through network, container, and service create commands. 

Remote IPAM drivers also exist and provide integration to existing IPAM tools.
