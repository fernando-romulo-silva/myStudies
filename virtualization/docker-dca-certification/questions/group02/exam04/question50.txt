When creating a docker container called ‘web’ that is running an Apache Web Server on port 80, 
you can allow direct access to the container service via the host’s IP by redirecting the host port 80 to the container port 80. 
Which command will accomplish this?


A)
docker run -d --name myweb -p 80:80 httpd:latest

B)
None of the answers is correct.

C)
docker run --name myweb -P 80/80 httpd/latest

D)
docker run -d --name myweb -P 80 httpd:latest 


































Answer A

The following run command options work with container networking:
–publish-all or -P

Publish all exposed ports to the host interfaces. 
Docker binds each exposed port to a random port on the host. 
Use the -p flag to explicitly map a single port or range of ports.

-p or –publish

It makes a port available to services outside of Docker, or to Docker containers which are not connected to the container’s network.
format: ip:hostPort:containerPort | ip::containerPort | hostPort:containerPort | containerPort
