Which option for exposing a service is best if your service is normally accessed via HTTP/HTTPS?

A)
NodePort

B)
LoadBalancer

C)
Ingress

D)
ClusterIP





































Answer C

NodePort service type is well suited for application services that require direct TCP/UDP access, like RabbitMQ for example.
If your service can be accessed using HTTP/HTTPs then Ingress is recommended.
Ingress is a Kubernetes API object that manages external access to the services in a cluster, typically HTTP/HTTPS.
