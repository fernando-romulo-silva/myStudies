Which type of network driver is best when the network stack should not be isolated from the Docker host, 
but you want other aspects of the container to be isolated?

A)
User-defined bridge networks

B)
Host networks

C)
Overlay networks

D)
Macvlan networks 




































Answer B

If you use the host network mode for a container, that container’s network stack is not isolated from the Docker host 
(the container shares the host’s networking namespace), and the container does not get its own IP-address allocated.

Host networks are best when the network stack should not be isolated from the Docker host, 
but you want other aspects of the container to be isolated.
