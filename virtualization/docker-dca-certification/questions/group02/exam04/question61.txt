What does the following error indicate?
x509: certificate signed by unknown authority

A)
User is running a docker command on UCP node without client certificate.

B)
User is running a docker swarm command on manager without client certificate.

C)
User is not registered on docker hub.

D)
User have entered incorrect captcha. 




































Answer A

When you are running a docker command, Docker attempts to verify that the certificate in 
use is signed by UCP’s certificate authority and that the domain name or IP used to connect to UCP 
is listed as a subject alternative name (SAN) in the UCP certificate.

If you see the following error “x509: certificate signed by unknown authority”, then Docker has not been provided with the ca certificate. 
To resolve this issue, use a UCP client bundle to connect to UCP from the CLI.
