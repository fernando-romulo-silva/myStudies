Which are the primary modes that Kubernetes uses to provide service discovery? 
(select two)

DNS

B)
Environment Variables

C)
Routing mesh

D)

Answer A and B

Kubernetes supports two primary modes of finding a Service, environment variables (injected by the kubelet when pods are created) and DNS. 

Both are valid options, however, the most common method to discover and reach a service from within 
Docker Kubernetes Service is to use the embedded DNS service.
