Which of the following differences between user-defined bridge networks and the default bridge network is FALSE?

A)
Linked containers on the default bridge network share environment variables.

B)
User-defined bridges provide better isolation and interoperability between containerized applications.

C)
Containers can be attached and detached from the default bridge network on the fly.

D)
User-defined bridges provide automatic DNS resolution between containers.





































Answer C

Bridge networks apply to containers running on the same Docker daemon host.

When you start Docker, a default bridge network (also called bridge) 
is created automatically, and newly-started containers connect to it unless otherwise specified.

You can also create user-defined custom bridge networks.
 
User-defined bridge networks are superior to the default bridge network for the following reasons:

· User-defined bridges provide automatic DNS resolution between containers.

· User-defined bridges provide better isolation.

· Containers can be attached and detached from user-defined networks on the fly.

· Each user-defined network creates a configurable bridge.

· Linked containers on the default bridge network share environment variables.
