When you publish a port of a service in swarm mode it is published on every node in the cluster by default? 

A)
TRUE

B)
FALSE











































Answer A

When you create a swarm service, you can publish that service’s ports to hosts outside the swarm in two ways:

· You can rely on the routing mesh. When you publish a service port, the swarm makes the service accessible at the target port on every node, 
  regardless of whether there is a task for the service running on that node or not. 
  This is less complex and is the right choice for many types of services.

· You can publish a service task’s port directly on the swarm node where that service is running. 
  This feature is available in Docker 1.13 and higher. 
  This bypasses the routing mesh and provides the maximum flexibility, including the ability for you to develop your own routing framework. 
  However, you are responsible for keeping track of where each task is running and routing requests to the tasks, and load-balancing across the nodes.

By default, services are using the routing mesh which makes the service accessible at the published port on every swarm node. 
When a user or process connects to a service, any worker node running a service task may respond.
To publish a service’s port directly on the node where it is running, use the mode=host option to the –publish flag.

For example:

$ docker service create \
  –mode global \
  –publish mode=host,target=80,published=8080 \
  –name=nginx \
  nginx:latest
