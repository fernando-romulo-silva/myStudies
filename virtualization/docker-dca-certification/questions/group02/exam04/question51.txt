Which docker network is used to connect the individual Docker daemon to the other daemons participating in the swarm?

A)
bridge

B)
docker_gwbridge

C)
overlay

D)
ingress





































Answer B

When you initialize a swarm or join a Docker host to an existing swarm, two new networks are created on that Docker host:

· an overlay network called ingress, which handles control and data traffic related to swarm services. 
  When you create a swarm service and do not connect it to a user-defined overlay network, it connects to the ingress network by default.
  
· a bridge network called docker_gwbridge, which connects the individual Docker daemon to the other daemons participating in the swarm.
