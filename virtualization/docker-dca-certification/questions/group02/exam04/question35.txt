What network port is used on Docker host to allow overlay network traffic in swarm mode?

A)
UDP port 7946

B)
TCP port 443

C)
TCP port 2377

D)
UDP port 4789





































Answer D

When creating overlay networks, the are some prerequisites:

· Setup the firewall rules
  You need the following ports open to traffic to and from each Docker host participating on an overlay network:
  TCP port 2377 for cluster management communications
  TCP and UDP port 7946 for communication among nodes
  UDP port 4789 for overlay network traffic

· Before you can create an overlay network, you need to either initialize your Docker daemon as a swarm 
  manager using docker swarm init or join it to an existing swarm using docker swarm join. 
  Either of these creates the default ingress overlay network which is used by swarm services by default. 
  You need to do this even if you never plan to use swarm services. 
  Afterward, you can create additional user-defined overlay networks.
