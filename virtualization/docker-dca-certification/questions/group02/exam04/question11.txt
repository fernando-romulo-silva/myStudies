Which type of network driver is best when you are migrating from a VM setup or 
need your containers to look like physical hosts on your network, each with a unique MAC address?

A)
Macvlan networks

B)
User-defined bridge networks

C)
Host networks

D)
Overlay networks




































Answer A

macvlan: Macvlan networks allow you to assign a MAC address to a container, making it appear as a physical device on your network. 
The Docker daemon routes traffic to containers by their MAC addresses. 

Using the macvlan driver is sometimes the best choice when dealing with legacy applications that expect to be directly connected to the physical network, 
rather than routed through the Docker hostâ€™s network stack.
