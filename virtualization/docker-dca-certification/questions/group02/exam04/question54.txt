Which of the following statement is false about ingress networks?

A)
Default ingress overlay network is used by swarm services by default.

B)
It transports mesh routing traffic from external clients to cluster services.

C)
It is automatically created when you initialize a swarm or join a Docker host to an existing swarm

D)
You cannot connect standalone containers to ingress networks.





































Answer D

The ingress network is created without the –attachable flag, which means that only swarm services can use it, and not standalone containers.
You can connect standalone containers to user-defined overlay networks which are created with the –attachable flag.

The routing mesh allows all the swarm nodes to accept connections on the services published ports. 
When any swarm node receives traffic destined to the published TCP/UDP port of a running service, 
it forwards the traffic to the service’s VIP using a pre-defined overlay network called ingress. 

The ingress network behaves similarly to other overlay networks, but its sole purpose is to transport mesh routing traffic 
from external clients to cluster services. 
It uses the same VIP-based internal load balancing as described in the previous section.
