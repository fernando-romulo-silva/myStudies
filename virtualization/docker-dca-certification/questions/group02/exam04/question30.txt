Which type of network driver is best when you need containers running on different Docker hosts to communicate, 
or when multiple applications work together using swarm services?

A)
User-defined bridge networks

B)
Overlay networks

C)
Macvlan networks

D)
Host networks




































Answer B

The overlay network driver creates a distributed network among multiple Docker daemon hosts. 

This network sits on top of (overlays) the host-specific networks, allowing containers connected to it 
(including swarm service containers) to communicate securely when encryption is enabled. 

Docker transparently handles routing of each packet to and from the correct Docker daemon host and the correct destination container.
