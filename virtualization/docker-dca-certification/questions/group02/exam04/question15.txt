When running network in ‘host’ mode, what option of ‘docker run’ can you use to override the hostname of the container?

A)
 -n

B)
--hostname

C)
--name

D)
-host





































Answer B

With the network set to host a container will share the host’s network stack and all interfaces from the host will be available to the container.
The container’s hostname will match the hostname on the host system.
Even in host network mode a container has its own UTS namespace by default.
As such –hostname and –domainname are allowed in host network mode and will only change the hostname and domain name inside the container.
