Which of the following statement is false about Virtual IP (VIP)?

A)
Traffic to the VIP is automatically sent to all healthy tasks of that service across the overlay network.

B)
When resolving the service's name, a VIP is returned.

C)
There are multiple VIP for a service, one for each task.

D)
When services are created in a Docker swarm cluster, 
they are automatically assigned a VIP that is part of the service's network. 




































Answer C

Internal Load Balancing

When services are created in a Docker swarm cluster, they are automatically assigned a Virtual IP (VIP) that is part of the service’s network. 
The VIP is returned when resolving the service’s name.
Traffic to the VIP is automatically sent to all healthy tasks of that service across the overlay network. 
This approach avoids any client-side load balancing because only a single IP is returned to the client. 
Docker takes care of routing and equally distributes the traffic across the healthy service tasks.
