Which of the following statements is false?

A)
Linked containers on the user-defined networks can share environment variables

B)
User-defined bridges provide better isolation and interoperability between containerized applications

C)
Containers can be attached and detached from user-defined networks on the fly

D)
Each user-defined network creates a configurable bridge






































Answer A

Linked containers on the DEFAULT bridge network share environment variables.
First, –link option, which is considered legacy.

Originally, the only way to share environment variables between two containers was to link them using the –link flag. 
This type of variable sharing is not possible with user-defined networks. 
However, there are superior ways to share environment variables. 

A few ideas:

* are file or directory mounting, use docker-compose, secrets and configmaps.

* User-defined bridges provide better isolation.

* All containers without a –network specified, are attached to the default bridge network. 
  This can be a risk, as unrelated stacks/services/containers are then able to communicate.

* Using a user-defined network provides a scoped network in which only containers attached to that network are able to communicate.

* Containers can be attached and detached from user-defined networks on the fly.

* Each user-defined network creates a configurable bridge

* User-defined bridge networks are created and configured using docker network create. 
  If different groups of applications have different network requirements, you can configure each user-defined bridge separately, as you create it.
