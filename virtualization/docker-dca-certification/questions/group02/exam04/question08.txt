Which of the following commands can you use to set a DNS server for all Docker containers?

A)
dockerd --dns-update IP_ADDRESS

B)
dockerd --set-dns IP_ADDRESS

C)
dockerd --dns IP_ADDRESS

D)
dockerd --dns-server IP_ADDRESS 





































Answer C

By using dockerd you can start the Docker daemon manually. 
On a typical installation the Docker daemon is started by a system utility, not manually by a user. 
However, this command can be useful to test things out and for troubleshooting problems.

To configure the DNS servers for all Docker containers you have to set the configuration at Docker daemon level.
By using dockerd command you can also configure it using flags.

For example, to set the DNS server for all Docker containers, use:
$ dockerd –dns IP_ADDRESS

To specify multiple DNS servers, use multiple –dns flags.

If the container cannot reach any of the IP addresses you specify, Google’s public DNS server 8.8.8.8 is added, 
so that your container can resolve internet domains.
