Which of the following provides supports for host networking?

A)
Docker EE for Windows Server

B)
Docker for Linux Distributions

C)
Docker Desktop for Mac

D)
Docker Desktop for Windows





































Answer  B

If you use the host network mode for a container, that container’s network stack is not isolated from the 
Docker host (the container shares the host’s networking namespace), and the container does not get its own IP-address allocated.

For instance, if you run a container which binds to port 80 and you use host networking, 
the container’s application is available on port 80 on the host’s IP address.

The host networking driver only works on Linux hosts, and is not supported on Docker Desktop for Mac, 
Docker Desktop for Windows, or Docker EE for Windows Server.

Host mode networking can be useful to optimize performance, and in situations where a container needs to handle a large range of ports, 
as it does not require network address translation (NAT), and no “userland-proxy” is created for each port.
