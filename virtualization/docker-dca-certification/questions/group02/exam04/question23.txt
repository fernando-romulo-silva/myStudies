Which of the following network drivers uses VXLAN data plane to decouple docker network from the underlay physical network?

A)
host

B)
overlay

C)
bridge

D)
macvlan





































Answer B

Linux bridges only operate locally and cannot span across nodes.
So, for multi-host networking we need another mechanism. 

Linux VXLAN comes to the rescue.

When a container sends a data packet, the bridge realizes that the target of the packet is not on this host.

Now, each node participating in an overlay network gets a so-called VXLAN Tunnel Endpoint (VTEP) object, 
which intercepts the packet (the packet at that moment is an OSI layer 2 data packet), wraps it with a header containing 
the target IP address of the host that runs the target container (this makes it now an OSI layer 3 data packet), and sends it over the VXLAN tunnel.

The VTEP on the other side of the tunnel unpacks the data packet and forwards it to the local bridge, which in turn forwards it to the target container.
