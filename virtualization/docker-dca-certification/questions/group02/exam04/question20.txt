Which docker run option can you use to publish a port so that an application is accessible externally?

A)
docker run --publish-port

B)
docker run --open-port

C)
docker run --expose

D)
docker run --publish





































Answer D

The following run command options work with container networking:
–expose

Expose a port or a range of ports inside the container. 
You expose ports using the EXPOSE keyword in the Dockerfile or the –expose flag to docker run. 
Exposing ports is a way of documenting which ports are used, but does not actually map or open any ports. 
Exposing ports is optional.

–publish-all or -P
Publish all exposed ports to the host interfaces. 
Docker binds each exposed port to a random port on the host. 
Use the -p flag to explicitly map a single port or range of ports.

-p or –publish
It makes a port available to services outside of Docker, or to Docker containers which are not connected to the container’s network.
