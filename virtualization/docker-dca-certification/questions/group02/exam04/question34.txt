Which of the following is incorrect about overlay networks?

A)
Overlay networks are only created on the manager nodes.

B)
Overlay networks use VXLAN data plane to decouples the container network from the underlying physical network (the underlay).

C)
Service management traffic is encrypted by default, but application data traffic can be encrypted as well

D)
Docker transparently handles routing of each packet to and from the correct Docker daemon host and the correct destination container.





































Answer A

The overlay network driver creates a distributed network among multiple Docker daemon hosts.

This network sits on top of (overlays) the host-specific networks, allowing containers connected to it (including swarm service containers) 
to communicate securely when encryption is enabled.

Docker transparently handles routing of each packet to and from the correct Docker daemon host and the correct destination container.
