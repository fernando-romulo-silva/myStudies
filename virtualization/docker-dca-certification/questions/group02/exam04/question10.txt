Which of the following commands should you use to ensure 
that overlay traffic between service tasks is encrypted?

A)
docker service create --network –encrypted

B)
docker service create --network --secure

C)
docker network create -d overlay -o encrypted=true

D)
docker network create -d overlay --secure




































Answer C

All swarm service management traffic is encrypted by default, using the AES algorithm in GCM mode. 
Manager nodes in the swarm rotate the key used to encrypt gossip data every 12 hours.

To encrypt application data as well, add –opt encrypted when creating the overlay network. 
This enables IPSEC encryption at the level of the vxlan. 
This encryption imposes a non-negligible performance penalty, so you should test this option before using it in production.

To set driver specific options use:
–opt , -o

For example:

$ docker network create -d overlay \
  –opt encrypted=true \
  my-network -network
