Which type of network driver is best when you need containers running on different Docker hosts to communicate, 
or when multiple applications work together using swarm services?

A)
Macvlan networks

B)
Overlay networks

C)
User-defined bridge networks

D)
Host networks




































Answer B

Different types and use cases for the built-in network drivers:

· User-defined bridge networks are best when you need multiple containers to communicate on the same Docker host.

· Host networks are best when the network stack should not be isolated from the Docker host, but you want other aspects of the container to be isolated.

· Overlay networks are best when you need containers running on different Docker hosts to communicate, 
  or when multiple applications work together using swarm services.
  
· Macvlan networks are best when you are migrating from a VM setup or need your containers to look like physical hosts on your network, 
  each with a unique MAC address.
  
· Third-party network plugins allow you to integrate Docker with specialized network stacks.
