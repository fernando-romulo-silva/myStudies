Which of the following network drivers connects the network stack of the container directly to Docker Host?

A)
bridge

B)
overlay

C)
macvlan

D)
host





































Answer D

If you use the host network mode for a container, that container’s network stack is not isolated from the Docker host 
(the container shares the host’s networking namespace), and the container does not get its own IP-address allocated.

Host networks are best when the network stack should not be isolated from the Docker host, but you want other aspects of the container to be isolated.
