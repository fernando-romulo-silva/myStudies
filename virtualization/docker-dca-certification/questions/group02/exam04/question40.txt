By default, in which mode are services running when using the routing mesh?

A)
Virtual IP mode

B)
DNSRR mode

C)
Swarm mode

D)
Global mode





































Answer A

Services using the routing mesh are running in virtual IP (VIP) mode. 

Even a service running on each node (by means of the –mode global flag) uses the routing mesh.

When using the routing mesh, there is no guarantee about which Docker node services client requests.

To bypass the routing mesh, you can start a service using DNS Round Robin (DNSRR) mode, 
by setting the –endpoint-mode flag to dnsrr.
