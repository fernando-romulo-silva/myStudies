Which of the following commands can you use to create a bridge network?

A)
docker network deploy

B)
docker create network

C)
docker network create

D)
docker network add





































Answer C

To create a new network use:
$ docker network create [OPTIONS] NETWORK

For example:

$ docker network create -d bridge my-bridge-network

The DRIVER accepts bridge or overlay which are the built-in network drivers. 
If you have installed a third party or your own custom network driver you can specify that DRIVER here also. 
If you don’t specify the –driver option, the command automatically creates a bridge network for you.
