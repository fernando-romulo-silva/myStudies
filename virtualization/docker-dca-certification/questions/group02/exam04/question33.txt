Answers B and C

When you create a macvlan network, it can either be in bridge mode or 802.1q trunk bridge mode.

· In bridge mode, macvlan traffic goes through a physical device on the host.

· In 802.1q trunk bridge mode, traffic goes through an 802.1q sub-interface which Docker creates on the fly. 

This allows you to control routing and filtering at a more granular level.
