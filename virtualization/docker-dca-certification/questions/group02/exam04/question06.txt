https:///_ heartbeat

C)
https:///_ping

D)
https:///_status 





































Answer C

You can use the https:///_ping endpoint to check the health of a single UCP manager node.

When you access this endpoint, the UCP manager validates that all its internal components are working, 
and returns one of the following HTTP error codes:

· 200, if all components are healthy
· 500, if one or more components are not healthy
