Answer C

When you deploy UCP, it starts running a globally scheduled service called ucp-agent. 

This service monitors the node where it’s running and starts and stops UCP services, 
based on whether the node is a manager or a worker node.

If the node is a:

· Manager: the ucp-agent service automatically starts serving all UCP components, including the UCP web UI and data stores used by UCP. 
  The ucp-agent accomplishes this by deploying several containers on the node.
  
· Worker: on worker nodes, the ucp-agent service starts serving a proxy service that ensures only authorized users and other UCP services 
  can run Docker commands in that node.
