Answres A, C and D

Garbage collection is an often-overlooked area from a security standpoint. 

Old, out-of-date images may contain security flaws or exploitable vulnerabilities; removing unnecessary images is important. 

Garbage collection is a feature that ensures that unreferenced images (and layers) are removed.

Secure computing mode (seccomp) is a Linux kernel feature. You can use it to restrict the actions available within the container.

Linux namespaces provide isolation for running processes, limiting their access to system resources without the running process being aware of the limitations.
From a security standpoint, it is best to avoid these situations.
