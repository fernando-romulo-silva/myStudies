You want to run an nginx web-server container as a background process. 

Which of the following is the correct command to make sure that the port 80 
of the container is mapped to port 8080 on localhost machine?

A)
docker run -itd --name web-server -P nginx:latest

B)
docker run -itd --name web-server -p 8080:80 nginx:latest

C)
docker run -itd --name web-server -p 80:8080 nginx:latest

D)
docker run --name web-server -p 8080:80 nginx:latest 


































Answer B

To start a container in detached mode, you use -d=true or just -d option.
 
By design, containers started in detached mode exit when the root process used to run the container exits.

To make a port available to services outside of Docker, or to Docker containers which are not connected to the container’s network, use the –publish or -p flag.

Here is anexample:

$ docker run -p 80:8080 ubuntu bash

This binds port 8080 of the container to TCP port 80 on the host machine.
