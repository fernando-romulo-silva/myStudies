A)
End-point

B)
Network Controller

C)
Sandbox

D)
Router





































Answer D

There are several high-level constructs in the Container Network Model (CNM). 
They are all OS and infrastructure agnostic so that applications can have a 
uniform experience no matter the infrastructure stack.

· Sandbox — A Sandbox contains the configuration of a container’s network stack. 
  This includes the management of the container’s interfaces, routing table, and DNS settings. 
  An implementation of a Sandbox could be a Windows HNS or Linux Network Namespace, a FreeBSD Jail, 
  or other similar concept. A Sandbox may contain many endpoints from multiple networks.
  
· Endpoint — An Endpoint joins a Sandbox to a Network. 
  The Endpoint construct exists so the actual connection to the network can be abstracted away from the application. 
  This helps maintain portability so that a service can use different types of network drivers without being 
  concerned with how it’s connected to that network.
  
· Network — The CNM does not specify a Network in terms of the OSI model. 
  An implementation of a Network could be a Linux bridge, a VLAN, etc. 
  A Network is a collection of endpoints that have connectivity between them. 
  Endpoints that are not connected to a network do not have connectivity on a network.
