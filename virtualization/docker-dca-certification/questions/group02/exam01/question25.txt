In which of the following cases you need to define a readiness probe on a Kubernetes Pod template definition?

A)
If you want your Container to be able to take itself down for maintenance.

B)
If you want to start sending traffic to a Pod only when a probe succeeds.

C)
If your Container needs to work on loading large data during startup.

D)
If you want to be able to drain requests when the Pod is deleted. 





































Answers A, B and C

If youâ€™d like to start sending traffic to a Pod only when a probe succeeds, specify a readiness probe. 

In this case, the readiness probe might be the same as the liveness probe, 
but the existence of the readiness probe in the spec means that the Pod will start without 
receiving any traffic and only start receiving traffic after the probe starts succeeding.

If your Container needs to work on loading large data, configuration files, or migrations during startup, specify a readiness probe.

If you want your Container to be able to take itself down for maintenance, you can specify a readiness probe that 
checks an endpoint specific to readiness that is different from the liveness probe.

Note that if you just want to be able to drain requests when the Pod is deleted, you do not necessarily need a readiness probe; 
on deletion, the Pod automatically puts itself into an unready state regardless of whether the readiness probe exists.


The Pod remains in the unready state while it waits for the Containers in the Pod to stop.
