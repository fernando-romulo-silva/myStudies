Answer A

To use a secret in an environment variable in a Pod:

· Create a secret or use an existing one. 
  Multiple Pods can reference the same secret.

· Modify your Pod definition in each container that you wish to consume the value of a secret key 
  to add an environment variable for each secret key you wish to consume. 
  The environment variable that consumes the secret key should populate the secret’s name and key in env[].valueFrom.secretKeyRef.
  
· Modify your image and/or command line so that the program looks for values in the specified environment variables.


This is an example of a Pod that uses secrets from environment variables:

apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: secret-env-pod
spec:
  containers:
  – name: mycontainer
    image: redis
    env:
      – name: SECRET_USERNAME
        valueFrom:
          secretKeyRef:
            name: mysecret
            key: username
