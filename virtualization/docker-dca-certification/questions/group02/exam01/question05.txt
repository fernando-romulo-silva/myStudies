Answer C

Swarm never creates individual containers. 
Instead, all Swarm workloads are scheduled as services, which are scalable groups of containers. 
Each of the services has a certain number of replicas or tasks.

A stack is used to describe a collection of swarm services that are related, most probably because they are part of the same application.
In that sense, we could also say that a stack describes an application that consists of one to many services that we want to run on the swarm.
