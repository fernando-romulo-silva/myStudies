When a container starts, it can be connected to multiple networks using â€“network. 
True or false?

A) 
FALSE

B)
TRUE










































Answer A

Containers can join multiple networks that allow you to provide fine-grained network policy for connectivity and isolation.

By default, a container will be created with one network attached. 
If no network is specified then this will be the default docker0 network.

After the container has been created more networks can be attached to a container using the docker network connect command.

Docker only allows a single network to be specified with the docker run command (when a container starts). 
To connect multiple networks docker network connect is used to connect additional networks.


STEP 1:
## Create Networks ##
docker network create bluenet
docker network create rednet`

STEP 2a: (automatically running)
## Create (1) Container in background called "c1" running busybox image ##
docker run -itd --net bluenet --name c1 busybox sh

STEP 2b: (created only to run later)
## Create (1) Container (notice no run flag - it is only created) ##
docker create -it --net bluenet --name c1 busybox sh

STEP 3:
## Attach remaining Network ##
docker network connect rednet c1
docker start c1
