B)
It can only scale one service at a time.

C)
It can only be applied on replicated services.

D)
It can only scale UP the service.





































Answer C

The scale command enables you to scale one or more replicated services either up or down to the desired number of replicas.

This command cannot be applied to services which are global services.

$ docker service create –mode global –name backend backend:latest

The following command tries to scale a global service to 10 tasks and returns an error. Ex:

$ docker service scale backend=10
backend: scale can only be used with replicated mode
