Which of the following commands can you use to exclude the manager node from running the tasks of a service?

A)
docker node stop manager

B)
docker node update --availability drain manager

C)
docker update node --availability drain manager

D)
docker node update drain manager





































Answer B

To prevent the scheduler from placing tasks on a manager node in a multi-node swarm, 
set the availability for the manager node to Drain.

The scheduler gracefully stops tasks on nodes in Drain mode and schedules the tasks on an Active node. 

The scheduler does not assign new tasks to nodes with Drain availability.

You can change node availability.
For example, to change a manager node to Drain availability use:

$ docker node update –availability drain node-1

This is useful when you want to:

· drain a manager node so that only performs swarm management tasks and is unavailable for task assignment.

· drain a node so you can take it down for maintenance.
