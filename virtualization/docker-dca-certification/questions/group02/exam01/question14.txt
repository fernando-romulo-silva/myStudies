Which availability mode needs to be set on a node when you need to perform maintenance on a node?

A)
OFFLINE

B)
MAINTENANCE

C)
DRAIN

D)
EVACUATE 





































Answer C

Sometimes, such as planned maintenance times, you need to set a node to DRAIN availability.

DRAIN availability prevents a node from receiving new tasks from the swarm manager.

It also means the manager stops tasks running on the node and launches replica tasks on a node with ACTIVE availability.
