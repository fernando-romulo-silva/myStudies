Which of the following options allow you to scale an app? (select two)

A)
Enable autoscaling

B)
Change the replicas value in the docker-compose.yml file

C)
Execute the 'docker stack deploy' command

D)
Setting the app to the global mode.





































Answers B and C 

Using either docker-compose.yml or a stack.

If the service is replicated (which is the default), specify the number of containers that should be running at any given time in the yml file.
Ex:

version: “3.8”
services:
	worker:
		image: dockersamples/worker
	deploy:
		mode: replicated
		replicas: 6
