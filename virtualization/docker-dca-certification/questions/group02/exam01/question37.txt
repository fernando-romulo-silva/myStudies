How can you deploy a new service with 4 instances of nginx with a single command?

A)
docker service scale --replicas 4 --name myservice nginx

B)
docker service create --replicas 4 --name myservice nginx

C)
docker service scale myservice=4 nginx

D)
docker service create --instances 4 --name myservice nginx 





































Answer B

Since the service its newly create we use
docker service create [OPTIONS] IMAGE [COMMAND] [ARG…]
Use the –replicas flag to set the number of replica tasks for a replicated service.

The following command creates a redis service with 5 replica tasks:

$ docker service create –name redis –replicas=5 redis:3.0.6
