TRUE

B)
FALSE









































Answer A

When Docker is running in swarm mode, you can still run standalone containers on any of the Docker hosts participating in the swarm, as well as swarm services.

A key difference between standalone containers and swarm services is that only swarm managers can manage a swarm, while standalone containers can be started on any daemon. 

Docker daemons can participate in a swarm as managers, workers, or both.

One of the key advantages of swarm services over standalone containers is that you can modify a serviceâ€™s configuration, 
including the networks and volumes it is connected to, without the need to manually restart the service. 

Docker will update the configuration, stop the service tasks with the out of date configuration, and create new ones matching the desired configuration.
