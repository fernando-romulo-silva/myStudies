Which of the following flags is not supported by docker service create command?

A)
-t

B)
-l

C)
-p

D)
-v 





































Answer D

The following flags are supported by docker service create command:

–label , -l : Service labels in order to set metadata on a service.

–publish , -p : Publish a port as a node port

–tty , -t : Allocate a pseudo-TTY


docker service command does not support -v or –volume flags. 
Instead the –mount flag is used when creating the service, or –mount-add when updating the service.

The type of mount can be either volume, bind, tmpfs, or npipe. 
Defaults to volume if no type is specified.
For example:

$ docker service create \
	–name my-service \
	–replicas 3 \
	–mount type=volume,source=my-volume,destination=/path/in/container \
	nginx:alpine
	

Here, for each replica of the service, the engine requests a volume named “my-volume” 
from the default (“local”) volume driver where the task is deployed. 
If the volume does not exist, the engine creates a new volume.
