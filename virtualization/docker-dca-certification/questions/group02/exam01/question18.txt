What is the difference between a replicated service and a global service?

A)
Replicated service runs one task on every node.
Global service runs multiple task on every node

B)
Replicated service can only be deployed on manager node. 
Global service can be deployed on both manager and worker node

C)
A number of tasks can be specified for a replicated service. 
There is no pre-specified number of tasks for global service

D)
Good candidates for replicated service are monitoring agents that you want to run on every node in the swarm. 
Good candidates for global service are http servers. 

































Answer C

REPLICATED OR GLOBAL SERVICES
Swarm mode has two types of services: replicated and global. 
For replicated services, you specify the number of replica tasks for the swarm manager to schedule onto available nodes. 
For global services, the scheduler places one task on each available node that meets the service’s placement constraints and resource requirements.
You control the type of service using the –mode flag. 
If you don’t specify a mode, the service defaults to replicated.
