Answer D

A ConfigMap is an API object used to store non-confidential data in key-value pairs. 
Pods can consume ConfigMaps as environment variables, command-line arguments, or as configuration files in a volume.
A ConfigMap allows you to decouple environment-specific configuration from your container images, so that your applications are easily portable.

Use a ConfigMap for setting configuration data separately from the application code.
For example, imagine that you are developing an application that you can run on your own computer (for development) 
and in the cloud (to handle real traffic). You write the code to look in an environment variable named DATABASE_HOST. 

Locally, you set that variable to localhost. 
In the cloud, you set it to refer to a Kubernetes Service that exposes the database component to your cluster.
