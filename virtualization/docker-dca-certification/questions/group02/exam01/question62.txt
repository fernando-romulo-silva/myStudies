What flag can you configure to a service to introduces a delay between tasks, 
so that the rolling restart happens gradually?

A)
-update-wait

B)
--update-pause

C)
--wait-delay

D)
--update-delay




































Answer D

When using ‘docker service create’ and ‘docker service update’ you can set a –update-delayflag to delay between updates.

For example:

$ docker service update –update-delay 30s redis

The –update-delay 30s setting introduces a 30 second delay between tasks so that the rolling restart happens gradually.

You can use the following units ns|us|ms|s|m|h.
