Chris wants to execute an application job using a Docker container. 
However, occasionally, this job fails and needs to be restarted. 
Chris doesn’t want to restart it manually if it fails. 
Which command should he use to make sure that the container restarts automatically?

A)
docker run --restart on-failure app

B)
docker run --restart failure-only app

C)
docker run --recover-failure app

D)
docker run --restart unless-stopped app


































Answer A

To configure the restart policy for a container, use the –restart flag when using the docker run command. 
The value of the –restart flag can be any of the following:

· no – Do not automatically restart the container. (the default)

· on-failure – Restart the container if it exits due to an error, which manifests as a non-zero exit code.

· always – Always restart the container if it stops. 
  If it is manually stopped, it is restarted only when Docker daemon restarts or the container itself is manually restarted.
  
· unless-stopped – Similar to always, except that when the container is stopped (manually or otherwise), it is not restarted even after Docker daemon restarts.
