What kind of resource should you use when creating Pods that are expected to terminate, such as batch computations?

A)
Deployment

B)
Job

C)
DaemonSet

D)
StatefulSet 





































Answer B

There are different kinds of resources for creating Pods:

· Use a Deployment, ReplicaSet or StatefulSet for Pods that are not expected to terminate, for example, web servers.

· Use a Job for Pods that are expected to terminate once their work is complete; for example, batch computations. 
  Jobs are appropriate only for Pods with restartPolicy equal to OnFailure or Never.
  
· Use a DaemonSet for Pods that need to run one per eligible node.
