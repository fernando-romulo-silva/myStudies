Which of the following mechanisms can you use to place services evenly on appropriate nodes in a swarm cluster?

A)
Replicated Mode

B)
Placement Constraint

C)
Placement Preference

D)
Routing Mesh 





































Answer C

While placement constraints limit the nodes a service can run on, placement preferences try to place tasks on appropriate 
nodes in an algorithmic way (currently, only spread evenly). 

For instance, if you assign each node a rack label, you can set a placement preference to spread the service evenly 
across nodes with the rack label, by value. 

This way, if you lose a rack, the service is still running on nodes on other racks.

Placement preferences are not strictly enforced. 
If no node has the label you specify in your preference, the service is deployed as though the preference was not set.
