In which state are service’s tasks initialized?

A)
NEW

B)
STARTING

C)
PENDING

D)
INIT





































Answer A

Tasks advance through a number of states until they complete or fail.
Tasks are initialized in the NEW state.
The task progresses forward through a number of states, and its state doesn’t go backward. 
For example, a task never goes from COMPLETE to RUNNING.
