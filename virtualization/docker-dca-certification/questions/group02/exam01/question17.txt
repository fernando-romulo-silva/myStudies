Which of the following scenarios will cause a swarm cluster to be in a lost quorum state?

A)
4 managers of which 2 are healthy.

B)
3 managers of which 2 are healthy.

C)
1 manager of which 1 is healthy.

D)
5 managers of which 3 are healthy.





































Answer A

In a swarm of N managers, a quorum (a majority) of manager nodes must always be available. 
For example, in a swarm with five managers, a minimum of three must be operational and in communication with each other. 

In other words, the swarm can tolerate up to (N-1)/2 permanent failures beyond which requests involving swarm management cannot be processed.
An odd number of managers is recommended because the next even number does not make the quorum easier to keep.
 
For instance, whether you have 3 or 4 managers, you can still only lose 1 manager and maintain the quorum. 
If you have 5 or 6 managers, you can still only lose two.
