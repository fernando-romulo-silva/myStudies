Which constraint role you use if you want to restrict a service to be scheduled only on the worker nodes in the Swarm cluster?

A)
node.role == worker

B)
swarm.role == worker

C)
node.role != worker

D)
swarm.role != manager 


Answer A

By default, swarm services can run on any node in the cluster. 
If you choose to constrain where services run, please note the following examples.

To ensure a service runs on worker nodes rather than managers, use a node.role constraint in the service definition. 

For example:

docker service create \
    –name nginx-workers-only \
    –constraint node.role==worker \
    nginx
    

Constraint expressions can either use a match (==) or exclude (!=) rule. 
Multiple constraints find nodes that satisfy every expression (AND match).
