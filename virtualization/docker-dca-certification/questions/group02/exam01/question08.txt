You want to take a node down for maintenance. 
Which command will drain a node that has tasks assigned to it?

A)
docker task update drain

B)
docker node update --availability maintenance

C)
docker node update --availability drain

D)
docker service update --availability drain




































Answer C

You can change node availability.
For example, to change a manager node to Drain availability use:

$ docker node update –availability drain node-1


This is useful when you want to:
· drain a manager node so that only performs swarm management tasks and is unavailable for task assignment.
· drain a node so you can take it down for maintenance.
