Answers B, C and D

A Secret is an object that contains a small amount of sensitive data such as a password, a token, or a key. 
Such information might otherwise be put in a Pod specification or in an image. 
Users can create secrets and the system also creates some secrets.
To use a secret, a Pod needs to reference the secret. 

A secret can be used with a Pod in three ways:
· As files in a volume mounted on one or more of its containers.
· As container environment variable.
· By the kubelet when pulling images for the Pod.
