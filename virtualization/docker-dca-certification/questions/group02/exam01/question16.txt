B)

C)
ReplicaSets

D)
Deployments





































Answer D

Don’t use naked Pods (that is, Pods not bound to a ReplicaSet or Deployment) if you can avoid it. 

Naked Pods will not be rescheduled in the event of a node failure.

A Deployment, which both creates a ReplicaSet to ensure that the desired number of Pods is always available
and specifies a strategy to replace Pods (such as RollingUpdate), is almost always preferable to creating Pods directly, 
except for some explicit restartPolicy: Never scenarios. 

A Job may also be appropriate.

A ReplicaSet ensures that a specified number of pod replicas are running at any given time. 
However, a Deployment is a higher-level concept that manages ReplicaSets and provides declarative updates to Pods along with a lot of other useful features. 

Therefore, we recommend using Deployments instead of directly using ReplicaSets, unless you require custom update orchestration or don’t require updates at all.
This actually means that you may never need to manipulate ReplicaSet objects: use a Deployment instead, and define your application in the spec section.
