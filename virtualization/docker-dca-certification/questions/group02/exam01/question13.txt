Which swarm unit is in charge to pass a task to its corresponding node using the HTTP request/response protocol?

A)
Dispatcher

B)
Orchestrator

C)
Scheduler

D)
Allocator 





































Answer B

Tasks and scheduling
A task is the atomic unit of scheduling within a swarm. 
When you declare a desired service state by creating or updating a service via HTTP API endpoints, the orchestrator realizes the desired state by scheduling tasks.
For instance, you define a service that instructs the orchestrator to keep three instances of an HTTP listener running at all times. 
The orchestrator responds by creating three tasks. Each task is a slot that the scheduler fills by spawning a container.
