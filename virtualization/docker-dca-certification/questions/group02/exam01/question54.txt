What docker command can you use to add a network to an existing service?

A)
docker service modify --add-network

B)
docker service set --add-network

C)
docker service update --network-add

D)
docker service add-network





































Answer C

You can change almost everything about an existing service using the docker service update command.

Use the –network-add or –network-rm flags to add or remove a network for a service.

Assuming that the my_web service from the previous section still exists, use the following command to add a network:

$ docker service update –network-add
