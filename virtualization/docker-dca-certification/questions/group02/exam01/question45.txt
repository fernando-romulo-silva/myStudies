Which of the following mechanisms can you use to configure services to run only on nodes with a specific metadata set?

A)
Control groups

B)
Placement Preference

C)
Placement Constraints

D)
Routing Mesh




































Answer C

While placement constraints limit the nodes a service can run on, placement preferences try to 
place tasks on appropriate nodes in an algorithmic way (currently, only spread evenly). 

For instance, if you assign each node a rack label, you can set a placement preference 
to spread the service evenly across nodes with the rack label, by value.

Placement constraints let you configure the service to run only on nodes with specific (arbitrary) metadata set, 
and cause the deployment to fail if appropriate nodes do not exist.
