D)
A 4-node cluster with 2 nodes down.




































Answers A and B

If the swarm loses the quorum of managers, the swarm cannot perform administrative tasks such
as scaling or updating services and joining or removing nodes from the swarm.

Nevertheless, tasks on existing worker nodes continue to run.

Swarm is resilient to failures and the swarm can recover from any number of temporary node failures (machine reboots or crash with restart) or other transient errors. 
However, a swarm cannot automatically recover if it loses a quorum.

In a swarm of N managers, a quorum (a majority) of manager nodes must always be available. 

For example, in a swarm with five managers, a minimum of three must be operational and in communication with each other. 
In other words, the swarm can tolerate up to (N-1)/2 permanent failures beyond which requests involving swarm management cannot be processed.

An odd number of managers is recommended because the next even number does not make the quorum easier to keep. 
For instance, whether you have 3 or 4 managers, you can still only lose 1 manager and maintain the quorum. 

If you have 5 or 6 managers, you can still only lose two.
