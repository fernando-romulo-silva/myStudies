Which of the following is not a configuration option you can use when creating a docker service?

A)
-network

B)
--mount

C)
--secret

D)
--volume 





































Answer D

When you create a service, you define its optimal state, that is, a number of replicas, 
network and storage resources available to it, ports the service exposed to the outside world, and more).

–secret Specify secrets to expose to the service
–network Network attachments
–mount Attach a filesystem mount to the service


DIFFERENCES BETWEEN “–MOUNT” AND “–VOLUME”

The –mount flag supports most options that are supported by the -v or –volume flag for docker run
