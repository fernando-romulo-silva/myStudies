Which of the following commands can you use to restart a docker container automatically, 
if the container exits due to an error, which manifests as a non-zero exit code?

A)
docker run --restart no nginx

B)
docker run --restart failure-only nginx

C)
docker run --restart unless-stopped nginx

D)
docker run --restart on-failure nginx




































Answer D

To configure the restart policy for a container, use the –restart flag when using the docker run command. 
The value of the –restart flag can be any of the following:

· no – Do not automatically restart the container. (the default)

· on-failure – Restart the container if it exits due to an error, which manifests as a non-zero exit code.

· always – Always restart the container if it stops. 
  If it is manually stopped, it is restarted only when Docker daemon restarts or the container itself is manually restarted.
  
· unless-stopped – Similar to always, except that when the container is stopped (manually or otherwise), 
  it is not restarted even after Docker daemon restarts.
