Which of the following commands configures a Redis container to always 
restart unless it is explicitly stopped or Docker is restarted?

A)

B)
docker run -d --restart-policy unless-stopped redis

C)
docker run -d --restart unless-stopped redis

D)
docker run -d --failure omit-stopped redis 




































Answer C

To configure the restart policy for a container, use the –restart flag when using the docker run command. 
The value of the –restart flag can be any of the following:

· no – Do not automatically restart the container. (the default)

· on-failure – Restart the container if it exits due to an error, which manifests as a non-zero exit code.

· always – Always restart the container if it stops. If it is manually stopped, it is restarted only when 
  Docker daemon restarts or the container itself is manually restarted. 
  
· unless-stopped – Similar to always, except that when the container is stopped (manually or otherwise), 
  it is not restarted even after Docker daemon restarts.
