Answer C

Containers running in a service are called “tasks” or “replicas”.
To scale the number of containers in the service you can use one of the following commands.

$ docker service scale=
$ docker service update –replicas=

For example, these commands are equivalent:

$ docker service scale web=5
$ docker service update –replicas=5 web
