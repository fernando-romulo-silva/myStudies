You have been asked to backup the swarm state on a Linux installation. 
By default, where can you find the swarm state and logs stored on the manager nodes?

A)
/etc/docker/swarm

B)
/run/docker/swarm

C)
/var/run/docker/swarm

D)
/var/lib/docker/swarm 














































Answer D

Docker manager nodes store the swarm state and manager logs in the /var/lib/docker/swarm/ directory.
Usually, on Linux distributions:

“/etc” is used for configurations (.conf files etc). here you find all the configs and settings for your system.

“/var” is usually used for log files, ‘temporary’ files (like mail spool, printer spool, etc), databases, and all other data not tied to a specific user. 

Logs are usually in “/var/log”, 

Databases in “/var/lib” (mysql – “/var/lib/mysql”), etc.
