Answers A, B and C

You can define one or multiple topologySpreadConstraint to instruct the kube-scheduler 
on how to place each incoming Pod in relation to the existing Pods across your cluster. 
The fields are:

· "maxSkew" describes the degree to which Pods may be unevenly distributed. 
  It’s the maximum permitted difference between the number of matching Pods in any two topology domains of a given topology type. 
  It must be greater than zero.
  
· "topologyKey" is the key of node labels. 
  If two Nodes are labelled with this key and have identical values for that label, the scheduler treats both Nodes as being in the same topology. 
  The scheduler tries to place a balanced number of Pods into each topology domain.
  
· "whenUnsatisfiable" indicates how to deal with a Pod if it doesn’t satisfy the spread constraint: 
  DoNotSchedule (default) tells the scheduler not to schedule it. 
  ScheduleAnyway tells the scheduler to still schedule it while prioritizing nodes that minimize the skew.
  
· "labelSelector" is used to find matching Pods. 
  Pods that match this label selector are counted to determine the number of Pods in their corresponding topology domain.
