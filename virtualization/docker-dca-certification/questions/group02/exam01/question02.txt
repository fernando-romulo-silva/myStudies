Which of the following units of the swarm can instruct a worker node to run a task?

A)
Dispatcher

B)
Scheduler

C)
Orchestrator

D)
Allocator





































Answer is B

A task is the atomic unit of scheduling within a swarm. 
When you declare a desired service state by creating or updating a service, 
the orchestrator realizes the desired state by scheduling tasks.

For instance, you define a service that instructs the orchestrator to keep three instances of an HTTP listener running at all times. 
The orchestrator responds by creating three tasks. 
Each task is a slot that the SCHEDULER fills by spawning a container.
