Which of the following is not a supported orchestrator in Docker EE?

A)
Swarmkit

B)
Minikube

C)
Kubernetes

D)
Docker Swarm





































Answer B

Docker Enterprise provides access to the full API sets of three popular orchestrators:

· Kubernetes: full YAML object support
· SwarmKit: Service-centric, Compose file version 3
· “Classic” Swarm: Container-centric, Compose file version 2

Docker Enterprise proxies the underlying API of each orchestrator, giving you access to all of the capabilities of each orchestrator, 
along with the benefits of Docker Enterprise, like role-based access control and Docker Content Trust.
