Which of the following flags is used to publish containers port(s) on an existing service in the swarm?

A)
 -p
 
B)
--publish-add

C)

D)
--publish-all








































Answer B

You can change almost everything about an existing service using the docker service update command.
When creating a service, use the -p or –publish flag.
When updating an existing service, use the flag is –publish-add. There is also a –publish-rm flag to remove a port that was previously published. 

$ docker service update \
  --publish-add published=8080,target=80 \
  myservice
  
$ docker service create \
  --name my_web \
  --replicas 3 \
  --publish 8080:80 nginx
