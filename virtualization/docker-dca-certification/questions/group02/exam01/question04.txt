You have just executed docker swarm leave on a node. 
What command can you run on the same node to confirm it has left the cluster?

A)
docker system status

B)
docker node status

C)
docker node ls

D)
docker node inspect self




































Answer D

You can run docker node inspect  on a manager node to view the details for an individual node. 
The output defaults to JSON format, but you can pass the –pretty flag to print the results in human-readable format.

$ docker node inspect self –pretty

In this case we don't have this option, so the correct answer is B

$ docker node status

C is wrong because this is a cluster management command and must be executed on a swarm manager node. 
To learn about managers and workers, refer to the Swarm mode section in the documentation.

$ docker node ls [OPTIONS]
