When there are seven managers in a swarm cluster, how would they be distributed across three datacenters or availability zones?

A)
3/2/2

B)
5/1/1

C)
4/2/1

D)
3/3/1





































Answer A 

In addition to maintaining an odd number of manager nodes, pay attention to datacenter topology when placing managers.

For optimal fault-tolerance, distribute manager nodes across a minimum of 3 availability-zones 
to support failures of an entire set of machines or common maintenance scenarios.

If you suffer a failure in any of those zones, the swarm should maintain the quorum of manager 
nodes available to process requests and rebalance workloads.


Swarm manager nodes         Repartition (on 3 Availability zones)
3                                              1-1-1
5                                              2-2-1
7                                              3-2-2
9                                              3-3-3
