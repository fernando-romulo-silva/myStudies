C)
When imposed placement constraints cannot be honored

D)
All of the scenarios are valid





































Answer D

Here are a few examples of when a service might remain in state pending:

· If all nodes are paused or drained, and you create a service, it is pending until a node becomes available. 
  In reality, the first node to become available gets all of the tasks, so this is not a good thing to do in a production environment.
  
· You can reserve a specific amount of memory for a service. 
  If no node in the swarm has the required amount of memory, the service remains in a pending state until a node is available which can run its tasks. 
  If you specify a very large value, such as 500 GB, the task stays pending forever, unless you really have a node which can satisfy it.
  
· You can impose placement constraints on the service, and the constraints may not be able to be honored at a given time.
