How many replicas does a global service run on nodes if we specify the node.role!=worker constraint?

a) Worker and manager nodes will run one replica.

b) Only workers will run one replica.

c) Only manager nodes will run one replica.

d) No nodes will run any replicas.









































Answer 'b'


A global service is a service that runs one task on every node. 
There is no pre-specified number of tasks. 
Each time you add a node to the swarm, the orchestrator creates a task and the scheduler assigns the task to the new node.
