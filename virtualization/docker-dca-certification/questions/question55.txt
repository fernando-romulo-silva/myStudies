How can we modify ports published on an already-deployed service?


a) It is not possible; we have to remove the service and create it again.

b) We can only change ports if the service is running using the host's network (--net=host).

c) We use docker service update --publish-add <NEW_PORT> --publish-rm <OLD_PORT>.

d) None of the preceding answers are correct.
















Answer(s) 'c'

When you update a service, you can update the ports:

$ docker service update --publish-add <NEW_PORT> --publish-rm <OLD_PORT>.
