Which of the following in the docker command to enable autolock on an existing swarm cluster?

a) docker swarm autolock

b) docker swarm update --autolock-swarm=true
​
c) docker swarm --autolock=true
​
d) docker swarm update --autolock=true










































Answer 'd'

To enable autolock on an existing swarm, set the autolock flag to true.

$ docker swarm update --autolock=true

To disable autolock, set --autolock to false. 

The mutual TLS key and the encryption key used to read and write Raft logs are stored unencrypted on disk. 

There is a trade-off between the risk of storing the encryption key unencrypted at rest and the convenience 
of restarting a swarm without needing to unlock each manager.
