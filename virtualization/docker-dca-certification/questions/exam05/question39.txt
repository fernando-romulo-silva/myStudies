You are using self-signed UCP certs and have a second DNS name that points to your internal controllers. 
When installing UCP, which flag should you use to add this additional name?

​A)​
--internal-server-cert
​
B)
--dns
​
C)
--san
​
D)
-external-server-cert










































The correct option is 'C'

The '--san'	add subject alternative names to certificates. 
The -san option can be used multiple times, such as --san www1.acme.com --san www2.acme.com.
