Which of the following statement is true about secrets?

a) ​Secrets can be created from any node in the cluster
​
b) Secrets are stored unencrypted on manager nodes
​
c) Secrets can be modified after they are created

d) Secrets can be created using standard input (STDIN) and a file









































Answer 'd'

Short for standard input, stdin is an input stream where data is sent to and read by a program. 

Secrets are ephemeral, unchaged mounted as files that contain the information.

A node only has access to (encrypted) secrets if the node is a swarm MANAGER 
or if it is running service tasks which have been granted access to the secret.
