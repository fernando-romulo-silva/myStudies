Grants in UCP are made up of which of the following?

a) Nodes, role and containers

b) Subject, node and containers
​
c) Subject, role and resource set
​
d) Subject, role and containers









































Answer 'c'

A grant defines who has how much access to what resources. 
Each grant is a 1:1:1 mapping of subject, role, and resource set.
 
For example, you can grant the “Prod Team” “Restricted Control” over services in the “/Production” collection.

A common workflow for creating grants has four steps:

* Add and configure subjects (users, teams, and service accounts).
* Define custom roles (or use defaults) by adding permitted API operations per type of resource.
* Group cluster resources into Swarm collections or Kubernetes namespaces.
* Create grants by combining subject + role + resource set.
