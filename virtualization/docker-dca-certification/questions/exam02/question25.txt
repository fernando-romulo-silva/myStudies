The correct answer is C

Labels are a mechanism for applying metadata to Docker objects, including:

* Images
* Containers
* Local daemons
* Volumes
* Networks
* Swarm nodes
* Swarm services

You can use labels to organize your images, record licensing information, annotate relationships between containers, 
volumes, and networks, or in any way that makes sense for your business or application.
