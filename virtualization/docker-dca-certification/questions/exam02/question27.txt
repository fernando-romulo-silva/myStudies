In Docker Trusted Registry, how would a user prevent an image, 
for example 'nginx:latest' from being overwritten by another user with push access to the repository?

A)
Tag the image with 'nginx:immutable'
​
B)
Use the DTR web UI to make the tag immutable.
​
C)
Remove push access from all other users.
​
D)
Keep a backup copy of the image on another repository.



































The correct answer is B

Docker tags are mutable named references to Docker images, much like branch refs in Git.

$ docker pull debian:buster 

DTR web UI help to make the tag immutable
