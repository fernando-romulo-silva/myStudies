A)
TRUE
â€‹
B)
FALSE












































The correct answer is A

By default, swarm services which publish ports do so using the routing mesh.

To bypass the routing mesh, you can start a service using DNS Round Robin (DNSRR) mode, 
by setting the --endpoint-mode flag to dnsrr. You must run your own load balancer in front of the service. 

A DNS query for the service name on the Docker host returns a list of IP addresses for the nodes running the service. 
Configure your load balancer to consume this list and balance the traffic across the nodes.
