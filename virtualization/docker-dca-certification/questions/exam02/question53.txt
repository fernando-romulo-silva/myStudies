Changing the storage driver makes any containers you have already created inaccessible on the local system.

A)
TRUE

B)
FALSE











































The correct answer is A

The devicemapper driver uses block devices dedicated to Docker and operates at the block level, rather than the file level.

Changing the storage driver makes any containers you have already created inaccessible on the local system. Use docker save to save containers, 
and push existing images to Docker Hub or a private repository, so you do not need to recreate them later.
