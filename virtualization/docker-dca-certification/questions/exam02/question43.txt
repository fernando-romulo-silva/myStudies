RBAC is based on declarative permissions definitions and cluster API objects. 
The RBAC mechanism enables us to configure fine-grained and specific sets of permissions that define 
how a given user, or group of users, can interact with any Kubernetes object in our cluster, 
or in a specific namespace of our cluster.
