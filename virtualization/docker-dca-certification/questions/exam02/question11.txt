What does the EXPOSE directive do?

A)
It causes the container to listen on a port.
​
B)
It documents ports intended for publishing at the time of running a container.
​
C)
It automatically publishes ports when running a container.
​
D)
It makes a container's port accessible externally.









































The correct option is B

The EXPOSE instruction informs Docker that the container listens on the specified network ports at runtime. 

You can specify whether the port listens on TCP or UDP, and the default is TCP if the protocol is not specified.

The EXPOSE instruction does not actually publish the port. 

It functions as a type of documentation between the person who builds the image and 
the person who runs the container, about which ports are intended to be published. 

To actually publish the port when running the container, use the -p flag on docker run to publish and map one or more ports, 
or the -P flag to publish all exposed ports and map them to high-order ports.
