How can we increase the number of replicas of a service running one instance (mark all the correct answers)?

a) This is not possible for global services.

b) By updating the number of replicas with docker service update --replicas <NUMBER_OF_REPLICAS> <SERVICE>.

c) The number of replicas can be increased using docker service scale <SERVICE>=<NUMBER_OF_REPLICAS>.

d) We can use docker service scale up to create a new replica.








































Answers 'a', 'b', and 'c'

The following command scales the “frontend” service to 50 tasks.

$ docker service scale frontend=50

or

$ docker service update --replicas=50 frontend


There are two types of service deployments, replicated and global.
For a replicated service, you specify the number of identical tasks you want to run.
A global service is a service that runs one task on every node. 
There is no pre-specified number of tasks. 
Each time you add a node to the swarm, the orchestrator creates a task and the scheduler assigns the task to the new node.
