What is used by the kernel to isolate resources when running Docker containers?

A)
Volumes
​
B)
Overlay networks
​
C)

Docker makes use of kernel namespaces to provide the isolated workspace called the container. 
When you run a container, Docker creates a set of namespaces for that container.
These namespaces provide a layer of isolation.
