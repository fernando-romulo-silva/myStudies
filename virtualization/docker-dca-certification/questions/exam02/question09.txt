Which of the following is true about building docker images?
​
A)
Every Dockerfile can have only one FROM directive.
​
B)
Only layers that have changed since the last build (and any following layers) are built.
​
C)
Every layer of the image is re-built every time docker build is executed.
​
D)
Every Dockerfile can have only one FROM directive.








































B is Correct

When you modify a Dockerfile and create a new image, Docker only rebuilds layers that have changed. 

The rest stay the same. This can be a good thing or a bad thing depending on how you structure your Dockerfile.
