Niels has an application that consists of multiple different containers that interact with one another. 
What should he use to manage this application in a Docker Swarm?

A) Niels should use a service with multiple tasks.
​
B) Niels should use docker-compose .
​
C) Niels should use a stack .
​
D) Niels should use a task








































The answer correct is C

Docker stack is ignoring “build” instructions. You can’t build new images using the stack commands.

It need pre-built images to exist. So docker-compose is better suited for development scenarios.

Niels already the container?
