The correct answer is D

Docker lets you create services, which can start tasks. 
A service is a description of a desired state, and a task does the work. 
Work is scheduled on swarm nodes in this sequence:

1) Create a service by using docker service create.
2) The request goes to a Docker manager node.
3) The Docker manager node schedules the service to run on particular nodes.
4) Each service can start multiple tasks.
5) Each task has a life cycle, with states like NEW, PENDING, and COMPLETE.

Task state

NEW	- The task was initialized.

PENDING - Resources for the task were allocated.

ASSIGNED - Docker assigned the task to nodes.

ACCEPTED - The task was accepted by a worker node.

PREPARING - Docker is preparing the task.

STARTING - Docker is starting the task.

RUNNING - The task is executing.

COMPLETE - The task exited without an error code.

FAILED	The - task exited with an error code.

SHUTDOWN - Docker requested the task to shut down.

REJECTED - The worker node rejected the task.

ORPHANED -The node was down for too long.

REMOVE - The task is not terminal but the associated service was removed or scaled down.
