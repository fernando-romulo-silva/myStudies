After joining a swarm, machines that are running Docker, are referred to as?

​A)
Pods
​
B)
Nodes
​
C)
Instances
​
D)
Hosts









































The correct answer is B

A node is an instance of the Docker engine participating in the swarm. 
You can also think of this as a Docker node. 
You can run one or more nodes on a single physical computer or cloud server, but production swarm deployments 
typically include Docker nodes distributed across multiple physical and cloud machines.
