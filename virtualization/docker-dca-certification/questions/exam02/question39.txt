Which Docker command is used to remove a base image, even 
if that image has containers that are based on it?

A)
docker rmi [image name] --force

B)
docker rm [image name] --force
​
C)
docker remove [image name]
​
D)
None of the above.







































A is correct

Removes (and un-tags) one or more images from the host node. 
If an image has multiple tags, using this command with the tag as a parameter only removes the tag. 
If the tag is the only one for the image, both the image and the tag are removed.
This does not remove images from a registry. 
You cannot remove an image of a running container unless you use the -f option. 

Docker rmi specifies that docker rmi is an alias for docker image rm

$ docker rmi -f fd484f19954f
