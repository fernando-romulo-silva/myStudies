You have been asked to backup the swarm state on a Linux installation. 
By default, where do Docker manager nodes store the swarm state and manager logs?

​
A)
/var/run/docker/swarm
​
B)
/var/lib/docker/swarm
​
C)
/etc/docker/swarm
​
D)
/run/docker/swarm



































The correct answer is B

The '/var/lib/' folder holds state information pertaining to an application or the system, 
so the '/var/lib/docker/swarm' has the swarm state and logs.
