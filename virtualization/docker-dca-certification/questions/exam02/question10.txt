Which of the following statements truly applies to the ENV directive?
​
​A)
It sets an environment variable on the host while the container is running
​
B)
It sets environment variables that are only visible at the container runtime.
​
C)
It sets environment variables that are made available in subsequent build steps and to containers at the runtime.
​
D)
It sets environment variables that are only visible during later build steps








































C is Correct

The ENV instruction sets the environment variable <key> to the value <value>, on the container. 

This value will be in the environment for all subsequent instructions in the build stage and can be replaced inline in many as well. 

$ docker run --name test-mysql --cpus 0.75  --env MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=root --detach --publish 3306:3306 mysql:5.7
