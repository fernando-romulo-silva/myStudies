Which algorithm docker uses to maintain a consistent cluster state across multiple managers?

A)
Floyd's Cycle Detection Algorithm.
​
B)
Round robin Algorithm
​
C)
Lee algorithm
​
D)
Raft consensus algorithm










































Answer 'D'

Using a Raft implementation, the managers maintain a consistent internal state of the entire swarm and all the services running on it. 

For testing purposes it is OK to run a swarm with a single manager. 

If the manager in a single-manager swarm fails, your services continue to run, but you need to create a new cluster to recover.
