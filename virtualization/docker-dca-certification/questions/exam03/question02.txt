From the below-mentioned option which of the following command is used sed for seeing all the running containers in docker?

A)
$ Sudo docker run -i -t alpine /bin/bash
​
B)
$ Sudo docker run container name
​
C)
$ docker ps
​
D)
All of the above














































C is Correct

$ Sudo docker run container name is not defined command.

$ docker ps is the only command used for seeing all the running containers in docker.

Hence the correct option is C.
