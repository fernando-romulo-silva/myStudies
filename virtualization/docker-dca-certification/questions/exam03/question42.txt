A is correct

A node is an instance of the Docker engine participating in the swarm. 
You can also think of this as a Docker node. 
You can run one or more nodes on a single physical computer or cloud server, but production swarm deployments 
typically include Docker nodes distributed across multiple physical and cloud machines.
