How do you configure Docker engine to use a registry 
that is not configured with TLS certificates from a trusted CA?

A)
Set and export the IGNORE_TLS environment variable on the command line.
​
B)
Pass the '--insecure-registry' flag to the daemon at run time.
​
C)
Set INSECURE_REGISTRY in the '/etc/docker/default' configuration file.
​
D)
Set IGNORE_TLS in the 'daemon.json' configuration file.










































B is Correct

To use a registry that is not configured with TLS certificates 

$ docker -d --insecure-registry registry:8443

or 

use the platform-independent daemon.json file, which is located in /etc/docker/ on Linux by default.

Set the following flag in the daemon.json file:

{
    "insecure-registries": ["registry:8443"]
}
