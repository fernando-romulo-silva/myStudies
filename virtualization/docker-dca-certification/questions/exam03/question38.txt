One of the nodes in your existing cluster is logging errors related to the storage subsystem 
it exists on in your infrastructure and needs to be taken offline.

Which command will allow you to gracefully remove the swarm it is a member of when executed ON the node itself?
​
A)
docker swarm unregister
​
B)
docker swarm leave
​
C)
docker swarm rm
​
D)
None of the above







































B is correct

Run the docker swarm leave command on a node to remove it from the swarm. 
For example to leave the swarm on a worker node:
 
$ docker swarm leave  

When a node leaves the swarm, the Docker Engine stops running in swarm mode.
