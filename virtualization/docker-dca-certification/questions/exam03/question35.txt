After creating a new service names "http", you notice that the new service is not registering as healthy. 
How do you view the list of historical tasks for that service by using the command line?
​
A)
docker inspect http
​
B)
docker servoce inspect http
​
C)
docker service ps http
​
D)
docker ps http







































C is correct


Lists the tasks that are running as part of the specified services.
In addition to running tasks, the output also shows the task history. 

For example, after updating the service to use the redis:3.0.6 image, the output may look like this:

$ docker service ps redis
