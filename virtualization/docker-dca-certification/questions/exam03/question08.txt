Which of the following commands is correct if container exits due to an error, 
which manifests as a non-zero exit code.
​
A)
docker run --restart unless-stopped nginx
​
B)
docker run --restart no nginx
​
C)
docker run --restart on-failure nginx
​
D)
docker run --restart failure-only nginx








































C is Correct

The on-failure restart policy lets you specify how many retries should be attempted. 

Docker will give up and leave the container in a stopped state if it fails to start multiple times in succession.
Example:

$ docker run httpd:latest --restart on-failure:5

In this example, Docker will try to restart the container five times after a failure (non-zero exit code). 

If the container fails to start on the fifth attempt, no more retries will be attempted. 

This option is useful for containers where a persistent starting error is unlikely to be resolved without manual intervention.
