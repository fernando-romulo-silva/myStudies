A)
docker templates

B)
docker repos

C)
docker libraries

D)
docker registries










































Answer 'D'

Docker registry could be hosted by a third party, as public or private registry.

Docker repository is a collection of different docker images with same name, 
that have different tags. Tag is alphanumeric identifier of the image within a repository.

Docker Hub is a cloud-hosted version of Docker Registry. 

A Docker user can opt for Docker Registry, which is a stateless, open source and scalable server-side application, 
if they prefer to maintain the storage and distribution of Docker images instead of relying on Docker's service.
