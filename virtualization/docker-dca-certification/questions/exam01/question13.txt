How can we ensure that a minimum of memory is available to run a container using soft limits?


a) We cannot ensure a minimum of memory is available for a container.

b) Using --memory.

c) This must be configured on your operating system.

d) We use --memory-reservation.































Answer 'd' - Allows you to specify a soft limit smaller than --memory  which is activated when 
Docker detects contention or low memory on the host machine. 
If you use  --memory-reservation, it must be set lower than --memory for it to take precedence. 

Because it is a soft limit, it does not guarantee that the container doesn't exceed the limit.

$ docker container run -d --memory-reservation=250m --name mymem1 alpine:3.8 sleep 3600

$ docker stats  // does not show RAM reservations.

But

If you run top  you will see no virtual RAM allocated. This setting is internal to Docker.
