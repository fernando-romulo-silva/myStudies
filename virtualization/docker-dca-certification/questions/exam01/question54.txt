​

The correct answer is C


Docker supports several storage drivers, using a pluggable architecture. 

The storage driver controls how images and containers are stored and managed on your Docker host.

1 - Stop Docker.

$ sudo systemctl stop docker

2 - Copy the contents of /var/lib/docker to a temporary location.

$ cp -au /var/lib/docker /var/lib/docker.bk

3 - If you want to use a separate backing filesystem from the one used by /var/lib/, format the filesystem and mount it into /var/lib/docker. 
Make sure add this mount to /etc/fstab to make it permanent.

4 - Edit /etc/docker/daemon.json. If it does not yet exist, create it. Assuming that the file was empty, add the following contents.

{
  "storage-driver": "overlay2"
}
