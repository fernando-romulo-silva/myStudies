Which docker feature allows you to control whether your containers start automatically when they exit, 
or when Docker restarts, and that they are started in the correct order

A)
startup rules
​
B)
restart policies
​
C)
placement rules
​
D)
startup policies




































The correct answer is B

Restart policies (--restart)

Using the --restart flag on Docker run you can specify a restart policy for how a container should or should not be restarted on exit.
When a restart policy is active on a container, it will be shown as either Up or Restarting in docker ps. 
It can also be useful to use docker events to see the restart policy in effect.
Docker supports the following restart policies:

* no - Do not automatically restart the container when it exits. This is the default.

* on-failure[:max-retries]  - Restart only if the container exits with a non-zero exit status. 
Optionally, limit the number of restart retries the Docker daemon attempts.

* always - Always restart the container regardless of the exit status. 
When you specify always, the Docker daemon will try to restart the container indefinitely. 
The container will also always start on daemon startup, regardless of the current state of the container.

* unless-stopped - Always restart the container regardless of the exit status, including on daemon startup, 
except if the container was put into a stopped state before the Docker daemon was stopped.
