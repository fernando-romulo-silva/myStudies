If we publish a service on port 8080 using -P, which nodes will expose port 8080?


a) No node will expose a service on port 8080.

b) All nodes will publish port 8080.

c) We should use privileged containers to expose port 8080.

d) We must use --network=host to publish ports below port 30000.








































Answer 'a'

When you access port 8080 on any node, Docker routes your request to an active container. On the swarm nodes themselves, 
port 8080 may not actually be bound, but the routing mesh knows how to route the traffic and prevents any port conflicts from happening.

$ docker service create \
  --name my-web \
  --publish published=8080,target=80 \
  --replicas 2 \
  nginx
  
But, it's 'P' = publish-all, it's not valid for swarn
