Which flag should be specified for 'docker/dtr install' 
to configure DTR to have single sign-on (SSO) with UCP?

A)
--dtr-external-url
​
B)
--url
​
C)
--sso-url
​
D)
--dtr-sso-url




































The correct answer is A

By default, users are shared between UCP and DTR, but you have to authenticate separately on the web UI of both applications.

You can configure DTR to have single sign-on (SSO) with UCP, so that users only have to authenticate once.

When installing DTR, use the docker/dtr install --dtr-external-url <url> option to enable SSO.
