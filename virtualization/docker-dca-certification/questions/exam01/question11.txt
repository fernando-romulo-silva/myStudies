What does the EXPOSE directive do?

A)
It causes the container to listen on a port.
​
B)
It documents ports intended for publishing at the time of running a container.
​
C)
It automatically publishes ports when running a container.
​
D)
It makes a container's port accessible externally.









































The correct option is B

The EXPOSE instruction informs Docker that the container listens on the specified network ports at runtime. 

You can specify whether the port listens on TCP or UDP, and the default is TCP if the protocol is not specified.

The EXPOSE instruction does not actually publish the port. 

It functions as a type of documentation between the person who builds the image and 
the person who runs the container, about which ports are intended to be published. 

To actually publish the port when running the container, use the -p flag on docker run to publish and map one or more ports, 
or the -P flag to publish all exposed ports and map them to high-order ports.


Basically, you have three options:

Neither specify EXPOSE nor -p
Only specify EXPOSE
Specify EXPOSE and -p

1) If you specify neither EXPOSE nor -p, the service in the container will only be accessible from inside the container itself.

2) If you EXPOSE a port, the service in the container is NOT accessible from outside Docker network, but from inside other Docker containers. 
So this is good for inter-container communication.

3) If you EXPOSE and -p (publish) a port, the service in the container is accessible from anywhere, even outside Docker network.
