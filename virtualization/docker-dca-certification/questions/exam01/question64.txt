Answer(s) 'b'

Docker Universal Control Plane (UCP) is an enterprise on- premise solution that enables 
IT operations teams to deploy and manage their Dockerized applications in production, 
while giving developers the agility and portability they need, all from within the enterprise firewall.

UCP provides four distinct sets of permissions. 

Full Control: Can do anything possible to resources. 

Restricted Control: Similar to Full Control, but with restrictions around container exec, privileged containers, host-mounted volumes, and other particularly sensitive operations.

View Only: Look, but donâ€™t touch. Can view and inspect resources, but nothing else.

No Access: Cannot view or otherwise access resources.
