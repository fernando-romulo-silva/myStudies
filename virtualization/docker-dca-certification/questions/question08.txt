What step should we follow to remove the leader node from the cluster?

a) Ensure all tasks run on other nodes by executing docker node update --availability=drain <LEADER_NODE>.

b) Remove the node from the cluster as the leader by executing docker swarm leave on the node.

c) Demote the leader node to a worker and then execute docker swarm leave on the node.

d) Once the node is out of the cluster, we can remove it completely using docker node rm <OLD_LEADER_NODE> from any available manager.
