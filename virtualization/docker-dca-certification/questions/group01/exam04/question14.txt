Which of the following commands can be used to delete an existing image?

​A)
docker image delete
​
B)
docker rmi
​
C)
docker rm
​
D)
docker rm image





































B is Correct

docker rmi

Removes (and un-tags) one or more images from the host node.
If an image has multiple tags, using this command with the tag as a parameter only removes the tag. 
If the tag is the only one for the image, both the image and the tag are removed.

$ docker rmi test1:latest
