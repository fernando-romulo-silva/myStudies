Which of the following are valid states of the AVAILABILITY column as shown when running 'docker node ls'? (select three)

​A)​
Drain
​
B)
Pause
​
C)
Active
​
D)
Running










































The correct options are 'A', 'B' and 'C'

To view a list of nodes in the swarm run docker node ls from a manager node:

$  docker node ls


The AVAILABILITY column shows whether or not the scheduler can assign tasks to the node:

* Active : That the scheduler can assign tasks to the node.

* Pause : The scheduler doesn’t assign new tasks to the node, but existing tasks remain running.

* Drain : The scheduler doesn’t assign new tasks to the node. 
          The scheduler shuts down any existing tasks and schedules them on an available node.
