Which instruction sets the working directory for any RUN, CMD, ENTRYPOINT, 
COPY and ADD instructions that follow it in the Dockerfile?

​A)​
VOLUME
​
B)
MOUNT
​
C)
WORKDIR
​
D)
DIR










































The correct option is 'C'

The WORKDIR instruction sets the working directory for any RUN, CMD, ENTRYPOINT, COPY and ADD instructions
that follow it in the Dockerfile. 

If the WORKDIR doesn’t exist, it will be created even if it’s not used in any subsequent Dockerfile instruction.
