​

https:///_ping
​

B is Correct

API endpoints which are specific to UCP

https:///_ping

Check the health of a UCP manager. 
Use the _ping endpoint to check the health of a single UCP manager node. 

The UCP manager validates that all of its internal components are working, and it returns either 200, 
if all components are healthy, or 500, if any aren’t healthy.
