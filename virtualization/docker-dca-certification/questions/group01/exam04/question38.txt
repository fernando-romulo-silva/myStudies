Which network allows Docker Trusted Registry components running 
on different nodes to communicate and replicate Docker Trusted Registry data?

​A)​
dtr-ol
​
B)
dtr-hosts
​
C)
dtr-br
​
D)
dtr-vlan










































The correct option is 'A'

To allow containers to communicate, when installing DTR the following networks are created:

Name    Type    Description 

dtr-br	bridge	Allows containers on the same node to communicate with each other in a secure way.

dtr-ol	overlay	Allows containers running on different nodes to communicate. 
                This network is used in high-availability installations, to allow Etcd 
                and RethinkDB containers to replicate their data.
