Which flag for a service would allow a container to consume more than 2 GB of memory 
only when there is no memory contention but would also prevent a container 
from consuming more than 4GB of memory, in any case?

​
A)
--limit-memory 4GB --reserve-memory 2GB
​
B)
--memory-swap 4GB --limit-memory 2GB
​
C)
--memory-swap 2GB --limit-memory 4GB
​
D)
--limit-memory 2GB --reserve-memory 4GB
​
E)
--limit-memory 2GB --reserve-memory 4GB











































A is Correct

--limit-memory: Limit prevents the binary inside the container from using more than that. 

--reserve-memory: Reserve holds those resources on the host so they are always available for the container.
