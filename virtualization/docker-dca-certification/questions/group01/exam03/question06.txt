D is Correct


Docker Universal Control Plane (UCP) is an enterprise on- premise solution that enables IT operations teams to deploy and manage their Dockerized applications in production,

To create a backup of a UCP manager node:

docker container run --log-driver none --rm -i \
    --name ucp \
    -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
    docker/ucp \
    backup [command options] > backup.tar
