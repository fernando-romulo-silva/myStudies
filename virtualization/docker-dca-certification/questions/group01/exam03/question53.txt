Which of the following commands will publish a service's port, but only on nodes that are running a task for that service?

A)
docker service create -p 8080:80 nginx
​
B)
docker service create -p mode=ingress,published=8082,target=80 nginx
​
C)
docker service create -p mode=host,published=8082,target=80 nginx
​
D)
docker service create -p 8080:80 --mode host nginx









































Answer 'C'

You can publish a service task’s port directly on the swarm node where that service is running.
The following example runs nginx as a service on each node in your swarm and exposes nginx port locally on each swarm node:

$ docker service create -p mode=host,published=8082,target=80 nginx
​
or

$ docker service create --name registry --publish published=5000,target=5000 registry:2
