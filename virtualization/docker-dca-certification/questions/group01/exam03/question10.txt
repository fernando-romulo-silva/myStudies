Which of the following scenarios would still allow the quorum to have maintenance in a swarm cluster? 
(Choose two)

​A)
A 3-node cluster with 1 node down.
​
B)
A 3-node cluster with 2 nodes down
​
C)
A 7-node cluster with 3 nodes down.
​
D)
A 4-node cluster with 2 nodes down.





































A and C are Correct

In a swarm of N managers, a quorum (a majority) of manager nodes must always be available.
For example, in a swarm with 5 managers, a minimum of 3 must be operational and in communication with each other.
