Which instruction is required if no executable is specified in the CMD instruction?

A)
EXEC
​
B)
CMD
​
C)
ENTRYPOINT
​
D)
RUN











































C is correct

RUN executes command(s) in a new layer and creates a new image. E.g., it is often used for installing software packages.

CMD sets default command and/or parameters, which can be overwritten from command line when docker container runs.

ENTRYPOINT configures a container that will run as an executable.
