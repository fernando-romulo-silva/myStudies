A host machine has four CPUs available and two running containers. 
The sysadmin would like to assign two CPUs to each container. 
Which of the following commands achieves this?

​A)
Set the '--cpuset-cpus' flag of the 'dockerd' process to the value 'even-spread'
​
B)
Set the '--cpu-quota' flag to '1.3' on one container and '2,4' on the other container.
​
C)
Set the '--cpuset-cpus' flag to '.5' on both containers
​
D)
Set the '--cpuset-cpu's flag to '1.3' on one container and '2.4' on the other container.













































C correct

--cpuset-cpus

Limit the specific CPUs or cores a container can use. 
A comma-separated list or hyphen-separated range of CPUs a container can use, if you have more than one CPU. 
The first CPU is numbered 0. 

A valid value might be 0-3 (to use the first, second, third, and fourth CPU) or 1,3 (to use the second and fourth CPU).

The value '.5' is 50% of the all cores.
