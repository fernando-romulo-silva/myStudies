Which command will drain a node that had a task assigned to it?

a) ​docker node update --role drain
​
b) docker node update drain

c) docker node demote drain
​
d) docker node update --availability drain












































The correct answer is 'D'

When you drain a node, the scheduler reassigns any tasks running on the node to other available worker nodes in the swarm. 
It also prevents the scheduler from assigning tasks to the node.

$ docker node update --availability drain <NODE>
