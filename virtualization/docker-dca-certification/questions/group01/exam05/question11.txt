d) docker swarm --replicas=5 webserver









































Answer 'b'

The scale command enables you to scale one or more replicated services either up or down to the desired number of replicas.

Run the following command to change the desired state of the service running in the swarm:

docker service scale <SERVICE-ID>=<NUMBER-OF-TASKS>

Ex:

$ docker service scale helloworld=5
