Which instruction specifies the Base Image from which you are building?

a) FROM

b) CMD
​
c) RUN
​
d) EXPOSE














































Answer 'A'

A Dockerfile usually starts with the FROM directive. 
This is used to specify the parent image of our custom Docker image. 
The parent image is the starting point of our custom Docker image. 
All the customization that we do will be applied on top of the parent image.
