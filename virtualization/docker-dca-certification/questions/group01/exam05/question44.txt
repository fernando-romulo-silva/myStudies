Which availability mode needs to be set on a node when you need to perform maintenance on a node?

a) MAINTENANCE
​
b) EVACUATE
​
c) OFFLINE

d) DRAIN












































Answer 'D'

When you drain a node, the scheduler reassigns any tasks running on the node to other available worker nodes in the swarm. 
It also prevents the scheduler from assigning tasks to the node.
