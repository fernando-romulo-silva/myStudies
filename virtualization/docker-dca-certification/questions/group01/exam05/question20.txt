In Docker Trusted Registry, how would a user prevent an image, for example 'nginx:latest' 
from being overwritten by another user with push access to the repository?

a) Tag the image with 'nginx:immutable'
​
b) Remove push access from all other users.
​
c) Use the DTR web UI to make the tag immutable.
​
d) Keep a backup copy of the image on another repository.









































Answer 'c'

Tag Immutability enables customers to rely on the descriptive tags of an image as a reliable mechanism to track and uniquely identify images.

Docker tags are mutable named references to Docker images, much like branch refs in Git.

$ docker pull debian:buster 

DTR web UI help to make the tag immutable
