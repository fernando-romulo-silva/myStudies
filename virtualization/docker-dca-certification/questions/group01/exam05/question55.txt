Which instruction will execute any commands in a new layer on top of the current image and commit the results?

a) ​ARG
​
b) FROM
​
c) RUN

d) CMD













































Answer 'C'

The RUN directive is used to execute commands during the image build time. 
This will create a new layer on top of the existing layer, execute the specified command, and commit the results to the newly created layer. 
The RUN directive can be used to install the required packages, update the packages, create users and groups, and so on.

The ENTRYPOINT or CMD that you specify in your Dockerfile identify the default executable for your image. 
However, the user has the option to override either of these values at run time.
