​
D)
All of the above











































D is Correct

There are various uses of dockers. 

Docker is used for the following things, to simplify the configuration: docker is used for putting your environment and configuration 
into coding and further deploying it. 

Managing the code pipeline: there are various types of system which is used in production and development, the journey of the code is
with development to testing and then to production. 
And hence it goes through different types of environments. 
In this way, docker helps in maintaining the consistency of the code pipeline. 
 
For the isolation of application: as in one container all application is wrapped together with dependencies, apps are isolated. 
They work independently on any hardware which is supported by docker. 

For the rapid development: docker cuts and removes the need for boosting an entire OS from scratch. 
This will reduce deployment time. And hence the deployment is rapid.
