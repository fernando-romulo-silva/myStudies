From the below-mentioned option which of the following command is used sed for seeing all the running containers in docker?

A)
$ Sudo docker run -i -t alpine /bin/bash
​
B)
$ Sudo docker run container name
​
C)
$ docker ps
​
D)
All of the above














































C is Correct

docker run container name is not defined command. 

docker run -i -t alpine /bin/bash is the command used for running the image as the container.

docker ps is the only command used for seeing all the running containers in docker.

Hence the correct option is C.

$ docker ps
