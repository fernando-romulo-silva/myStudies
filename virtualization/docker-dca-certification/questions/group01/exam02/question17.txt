​
B)

​
C)
docker tag image SOURCE_IMAGE[:TAG] TARGET_IMAGE[:TAG]

D)
docker tag SOURCE_IMAGE[:TAG] TARGET_IMAGE[:TAG]











































D is correct

An image name is made up of slash-separated name components, optionally prefixed by a registry hostname. 
The hostname must comply with standard DNS rules, but may not contain underscores.
 
If a hostname is present, it may optionally be followed by a port number in the format :8080. 
If not present, the command uses Docker’s public registry located at registry-1.docker.io by default. 

Name components may contain lowercase letters, digits and separators. 

A separator is defined as a period, one or two underscores, or one or more dashes. 
A name component may not start or end with a separator.


To tag a local image with ID “0e5574283393” into the “fedora” repository with “version1.0”:

$ docker tag 0e5574283393 fedora/httpd:version1.0


To tag a local image with name “httpd” into the “fedora” repository with “version1.0”:

$ docker tag httpd fedora/httpd:version1.0


Tag an image for a private repository

To push an image to a private registry and not the central Docker registry you must tag it with the registry hostname and port (if needed).

$ docker tag 0e5574283393 myregistryhost:5000/fedora/httpd:version1.0
