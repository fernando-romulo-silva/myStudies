It is OK to have more than one RUN instruction in the Docker file.

​A)
TRUE
​
B)
FALSE











































A is correct

RUN instruction allows you to install your application and packages required for it. 
It executes any commands on top of the current image and creates a new layer by committing the results. 
Often you will find multiple RUN instructions in a Dockerfile.

RUN - command triggers while we build the docker image.

CMD - command triggers while we launch the created docker image.
