The correct option is C

Docker uses a technology called namespaces to provide the isolated workspace called the container. 
When you run a container, Docker creates a set of namespaces for that container.
These namespaces provide a layer of isolation. 
Each aspect of a container runs in a separate namespace and its access is limited to that namespace.

Docker Engine uses the following namespaces on Linux:

PID namespace for process isolation.
NET namespace for managing network interfaces.
IPC namespace for managing access to IPC resources.
MNT namespace for managing filesystem mount points.
UTS namespace for isolating kernel and version identifiers.
