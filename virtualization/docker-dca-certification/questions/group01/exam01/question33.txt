What is the docker command to create a container with custom DNS server(s)?

​
A)
docker container create --add-dns=IP_ADDRESS
​
B)
docker container create --dns=IP_ADDRESS
​
C)
docker container create --custom-dns=IP_ADDRESS
​
D)
docker container create --set-dns=IP_ADDRESS




































The correct answer is B

By default, a container inherits the DNS settings of the host, as defined in the /etc/resolv.conf configuration file. 

Containers that use the default bridge network get a copy of this file, whereas containers that use a custom network use Docker’s embedded DNS server, 
which forwards external DNS lookups to the DNS servers configured on the host.

Custom hosts defined in /etc/hosts are not inherited. 

To pass additional hosts into your container, refer to add entries to container hosts file in the docker run reference documentation. 

You can override these settings on a per-container basis.

$ docker run -d -t --name ubuntuDNS --dns="1.0.0.1" ubuntu
