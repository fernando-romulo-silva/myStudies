Besides the read only image and the writable container layer, which other ways 
can containers take up disk space? (Select all that apply)

A)
Volumes and bind mounts used by the container.

B)
Disk used for the container's configuration files, which are typically small.
​
C)
Data stored in tmpfs
​
D)
Disk space used for log files if you use the json-file logging driver.




































The correct answer are A, B and D

A - Bind mounts have limited functionality compared to volumes. 
When you use a bind mount, a file or directory on the host machine is mounted into a container. 
  
B - Docker swarm service configs allow you to store non-sensitive information, 
such as configuration files, outside a service’s image or running containers.

C - Containers are stateless, and the logs are stored on the Docker host in JSON files by default.
