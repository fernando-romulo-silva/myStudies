What Are Docker Image Layers?

$ Each layer is an image itself, just one without a human-assigned tag. 
They have auto-generated IDs though.

$ Each layer stores the changes compared to the image it’s based on.

$ An image can consist of a single layer (that’s often the case when the squash command was used).

$ Each instruction in a Dockerfile results in a layer. 
(Except for multi-stage builds, where usually only the layers in the final image are pushed, or when an image is squashed to a single layer).

$ Layers are used to avoid transferring redundant information and skip build steps which have not changed 
(according to the Docker cache).
