Which of the following lvm mode should a production host using the device mapper as a storage driver use?

A)
​Loop-lvm
​
B)
ZFS
​
C)
Direct-lvm
​
D)
Overlay





































The correct option is C

Production hosts using the devicemapper storage driver must use direct-lvm mode. 

This mode uses block devices to create the thin pool. 

This is faster than using loopback devices, uses system resources more efficiently, and block devices can grow as needed. 

However, more setup is required than in loop-lvm mode.
