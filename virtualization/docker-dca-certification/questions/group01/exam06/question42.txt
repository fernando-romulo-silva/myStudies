To decrease the image pull time for geographically dispersed users you can configure which DTR option?

A)
DTR CDN
​
B)
DTR cache
​
C)
DTR Edge
​
D)
DTR Local Registry











































Answer 'B'

To decrease the time to pull an image, you can deploy DTR caches geographically closer to users.
Caches are transparent to users, since users still login and pull images using the DTR url address. 
DTR checks if users are authorized to pull the image, and redirects the request to the cache.
