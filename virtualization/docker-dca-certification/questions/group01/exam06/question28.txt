Which of the following namespaces is disabled by default and must be enabled at Docker engine runtime in order to be used?

a) user

b) net

c) mnt

d) pid








































Answer 'A'

Docker makes use of the namespace features of the Linux Kernel as one of the ways to provide container isolation. 

By default, Docker uses:

* PID
* Cgroup
* IPC
* Network
* Mount
* UTS

You might notice that the last namespace, User is not used by default, perhaps for good reasons. 

User namespace support was only added recently this year, and in this post, 
we can look at some of the problems you might encounter when trying to use Docker with the User namespace feature enabled.
