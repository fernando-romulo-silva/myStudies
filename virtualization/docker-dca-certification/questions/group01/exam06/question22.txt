Which constraint role you use if you want to restrict a service to be scheduled in a manager in the Swarm cluster?

a) swarm.role != worker
​
b) node.role == manager

c) swarm.role == manager
​
d) node.role != manager








































Answer 'b'

The most common method ot separate workers and managers is make a placement constraint on node.role==worker 
for every service you only want to run on workers vs the manager:

version "3.1"
services: 
  foo:
    image: hello-world
    deploy:
      placement:
         - node.role: manager
