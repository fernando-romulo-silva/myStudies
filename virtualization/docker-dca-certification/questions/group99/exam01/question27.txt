What is the difference between docker image import and docker image load for uploading an image to a Docker host?

a) There is no difference between the commands.

b) Both import the same image content.

c) docker image import will only retrieve image layers containing binaries, libraries, 
and configurations for the process but without any meta-information about how to launch the process, 
what volumes to use, what ports should be used, and so on.

d) We can only use docker image import to create new images.






































Answer 'c'

docker import – docker import creates one image from one tarball which is not even an image (just a filesystem you want to import as an image). 
Create an empty filesystem image and import the contents of the tarball

docker load – docker load creates potentially multiple images from a tarred repository (since docker save can save multiple images in a tarball). 
Loads a tarred repository from a file or the standard input stream
