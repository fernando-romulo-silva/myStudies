How can we deploy two applications using the same docker-compose.yaml file?


a) We cannot deploy two applications using the same docker-compose.yaml file.

b) Docker Compose can deploy two applications using projects to ensure applications run using different volumes and ports.

c) We can use environment variables for fixed resources to avoid any resource usage conflicts.

d) The only option to avoid application component conflicts is to deploy applications on different clusters.



















Answer 'c'

Ex: 

common-services.yml

services:
  webapp:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "8000:8000"
    volumes:
      - "/data"
      
      
 You can go further and define (or re-define) configuration locally in docker-compose.yml:
 
 services:
  web:
    extends:
      file: common-services.yml
      service: webapp
    environment:
      - DEBUG=1
    cpu_shares: 5

  important_web:
    extends: web
    cpu_shares: 10
