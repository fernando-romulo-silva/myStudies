Which concept routes requests to containers running for a deployed service?


a) An ingress overlay network is used to route requests to different services' backends using a round-robin endpoint by default.

b) A docker_gwbridge network is used to communicate with containers on different hosts.

c) An ingress overlay network is used to route requests to different services' backends using the service's virtual IP by default.

d) We must use a host network to route requests to containers.









































Answer 'c'

Docker Engine swarm mode makes it easy to publish ports for services to make them available to resources outside the swarm. 
All nodes participate in an ingress routing mesh.
