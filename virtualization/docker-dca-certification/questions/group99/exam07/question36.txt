Which is the best node distribution if we have to deploy a cluster with seven managers with distributed high availability?

a) Four manager nodes in a data center and three manager nodes on a different one.

b) Two managers in a data center, two managers in a second one, and three in another.

c) All managers should be in the same data center.

d) We cannot manage distributed availability with 7 nodes; we need at least 9.
































Answer 'b'

A swarm cluster comprises one or more manager and worker nodes.

To ensure high availability (HA) of the swarm control plane in production, 
you should include an odd number (3+) of manager nodes, usually no more than seven. 

They should be spread across availability zones and connected by high-speed reliable networks.
