Which command allows us to review and recover lost space due to "dangling images" and dead containers?

a) docker system rm

b) docker system prune

c) docker image rm --filter="dangling"

d) docker container rm -a










































Answers 'b'

Docker images consist of multiple layers. 
Dangling images are layers that have no relationship to any tagged images. 
They no longer serve a purpose and consume disk space. 

They can be located by adding the filter flag, -f with a value of dangling=true to the Docker images command.

To list dangling:

$ docker images -f dangling=true

To clean dangling:

$ docker system prune
