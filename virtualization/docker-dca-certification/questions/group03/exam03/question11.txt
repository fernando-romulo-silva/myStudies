Your company recently closed a mega deal with an upcoming cloud provider to use their state-of-the-art storage technology for your applications. 
Since it's an upcoming cloud provider, its provisioner is not shipped by default in Kubernetes. 
Which of the following would most appropriate way to use their storage in Kubernetes?

A)
Build the storage provisioner by yourself

B)
Since their provisioner is not shipped with Kubernetes, a new storage type cannot be used

C)
Use the 3rd party storage provisioner provided by the upcoming cloud provider

D)
Pay Kubernetes team to build the provisioner for your company



































Answer C

If your required provisioner is not shipped with Kubernetes, external/ 3rd party provisioners following specifications defined by Kubernetes can be used.
Option C is correct as the cloud provider provides their 3rd party storage provisioner to access their storage via Kubernetes, 
this would be the most appropriate choice.

Option A is incorrect as it is not recommended since 3rd party provisioner is already provided by the cloud provider.

Option B is incorrect as in this case the required provisioner is not shipped by default & external 3rd party provisioners are available that can be used to access the new storage type.

Option D is incorrect maybe or may not be feasible & not recommended since 3rd party provisioner is already provided by the cloud provider.
