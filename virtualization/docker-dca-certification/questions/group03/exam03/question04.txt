A service named “HelloWorld” is deployed to docker swarm with 5 tasks (5 containers running the service). 
Which of the following command scales the mentioned service to 15 tasks:

A)
docker service scale HelloWorld=5

B)
docker service scale HelloWorld=10

C)
docker service scale HelloWorld=20

D)
docker service scale HelloWorld=15




































Answer D

docker service scale HelloWorld=15 scales the “HelloWorld” service to 15 tasks.

Option A is incorrect As it scales the service to 5, which is the same as the current state of service, whereas 15 is required.

Option B is incorrect As it scales the service to 10 tasks, whereas 15 is required.

Option C is incorrect As it scales the service to 20 tasks, an extra 5 tasks than the required number.
