When pods are running in the host network (e.g. Linux), & q43 is attached to the host network of a node, 
can they still communicate with all pods on all nodes without a NAT device?

A)
Yes they can communicate

B)
No, they can’t as NAT is required

C)
No since pods running on the host network don’t get an IP

D)
Yes since pods running on the host network needs global IP




































Answer A

When pods are attached to the host network of a node they can still communicate with all pods on all nodes without NAT 
as it’s a fundamental requirement for any networking implementation.

Option B is incorrect as NAT is not required.

Option C is incorrect as every pod running in Kubernetes gets a unique IP.

Option D is incorrect as running pods by default get private IPs assigned, not global IP.
