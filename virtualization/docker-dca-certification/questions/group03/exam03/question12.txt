There's a requirement to set up a production Kubernetes cluster because the cluster being available is very critical. 
Which of the following options accomplishes that?

A)
Cluster spans across multiple zones/data centers

B)
Load balancing traffic to cluster's API server

C)
Auto scaling worker nodes

D)
Set namespace limits




































Answer A

Option A is correct as spreading the cluster across multiple data centers/zones/regions makes it resilient against physical outages.
If keeping a cluster available always is critical, consider creating a cluster that runs across multiple data centers/zones. 
By spreading a cluster across multiple zones in the same/different region, it can improve the chances that your cluster will continue to function 
even if one zone becomes unavailable.


Option B is incorrect as it is related to distributing traffic rather than making it resilient to outages.

Option C is incorrect as auto-scaling worker nodes are related to managing individual instances of worker nodes rather than the cluster as a whole.

Option D is incorrect as it is related to setting resources limit on namespaces rather than the availability of clusters.
