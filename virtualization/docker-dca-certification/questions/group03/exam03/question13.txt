There a new internal admin tool needs to be deployed on Kubernetes which should be accessible only to services 
in Kubernetes & not from outside the Kubernetes cluster. 
Which of the following would be the appropriate method to expose it?

A)
Ingress

B)
NodePort

C)
ClusterIP

D)
Load Balancer



































Answer C

clusterIP is the default Kubernetes service & provides connectivity within the cluster & can't be accessed from outside.
Option C is correct as provides connectivity within the cluster & can't be accessed from outside, hence appropriate for the use case.

Option A is incorrect as itâ€™s a totally different service & used to provide HTTP routing configurations.
Option B is incorrect as NodePort publicly exposes a service on a static port, hence not suitable for the mentioned use case.
Option D is incorrect as a load balancer is used to map external IP addresses to services inside the cluster.
