Your company is running an 11-manager docker swarm cluster. 
What is the maximum number of manager losses can your cluster tolerate?

A)
4

B)
5

C)
6

D)
7




































Correct Answer: B

Your cluster can tolerate a maximum loss of 5 managers. 
An N manager cluster can tolerate the loss of utmost (N-1)/2 managers, ie. (11-1)/2 = 5 in the above question.
An odd number of manager nodes are recommended for high availability.

Option A is incorrect As it is not the maximum number of managers loss the cluster can tolerate.

Option C is incorrect As it's more than the maximum number of managers loss the cluster can tolerate.

Option D is incorrect As it's more than the maximum number of managers loss the cluster can tolerate.
