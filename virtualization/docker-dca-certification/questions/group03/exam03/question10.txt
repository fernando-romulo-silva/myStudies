There is a new compliance requirement from the company’s CISO that a pod’s associated persistent volume (including the associated storage asset) 
should be deleted as soon as it’s been released of its claim. 
Which of the following reclaim policy accomplishes this?


A)
AutoDelete

B)
Recycle

C)
Delete

D)
Prune


































Correct Answer: C

Delete is used for deleting the associated storage asset such as OpenStack, Cinder volume, Azure Disk, GCE Persistent Disk, 
or AWS Elastic Block Storage when a persistent volume has been released of its claim.

Option A is incorrect as there’s no such policy exists as AutoDelete.

Option B is incorrect as Recycle does a basic scrub (rm -rf /thevolume/*) & only NFS & HostPath supports recycling, whereas deletion is required.

Option D is incorrect as there’s no such policy exists as Prune.
