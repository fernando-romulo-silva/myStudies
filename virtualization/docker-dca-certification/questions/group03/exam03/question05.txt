Your company has to deploy a backend API named “web” in the docker swarm with a single replica & it needs to be available to resources outside the swarm. 
Backend API runs on port 80 (TCP) & needs to be available at port 8080 (TCP) to resources outside swarm. 
Which of the following command accomplishes that?

A)
docker service create –name web –publish published=80,target=8080 web

B)
docker service create –name web p 8080:80 web

C)
docker service create –name web p 80:8080 web

D)
docker service create –name web p: 8080:80/udp




































Answer B

Option B is correct As it publishes port 8080 for resources outside the swarm & port 80 as the target port to which the service “web” listens.
It is a short syntax version that publishes port 8080 for resources outside the swarm & port 80 as the target port.
Long syntax version is as follows.

$ docker service create –name web –publish published=8080,target=80 web

Option A is incorrect As the published & target port is reversed.

Option C is incorrect As it is just the short syntax version of option A.

Option D is incorrect As it publishes the correct port, but the wrong port type ie. UDP whereas TCP is required.
