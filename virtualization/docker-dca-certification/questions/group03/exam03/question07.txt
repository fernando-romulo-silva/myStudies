Which of the following file does the docker daemon look to exclude files & directories to avoid them being added to the docker image?

A)
.gitignore

B)
.dockerignore

C)
.ignore

D)
.exclude





































Answer B

Option B is correct as .dockerignore is the file that contains files & directories to be excluded from being added to the docker image.
Before the docker, CLI sends the context to the docker daemon, 
it looks for a file named .dockerignore in the root directory of the context & modifies the context to exclude files and directories that match patterns in it. 
This helps to avoid unnecessarily sending large or sensitive files and directories to the daemon and potentially adding them to images.

Option A is incorrect as .gitignore is used to tell git version control to ignore files & directories from the version control system.

Option C is incorrect as the docker daemon looks for a file named .dockerignore. There is no such .ignore file.

Option D is incorrect as the docker daemon looks for a file named .dockerignore. There is no such .exclude file.
