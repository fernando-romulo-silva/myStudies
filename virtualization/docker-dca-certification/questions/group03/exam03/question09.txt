A REST API service in a pod needs to access database credentials to connect ie. Host, username & secret password. 
Which one of the following would be the most appropriate place to store them for secure access?

A)
configMap

B)
Secret

C)
Manually set & encrypt them in etcd cluster

D)
Store them in application code as plaintext since only developers have access to the code




































Answer B

The secret is purpose-built to store sensitive data which otherwise might be put into plaintext code or pod configuration.
A secret is an object that contains a small amount of sensitive data such as a password or a key & they are independent of pods.

Option A is incorrect as configMap is used to store non-confidential data hence not suitable to store passwords & similar secret data.

Option C is incorrect as manually setting data into etcd is not recommended as it can be error prone to manage & scale sensitive data in such a way.

Option D is incorrect as storing sensitive data as part of application code is not recommended as it increases the chance of compromise.
