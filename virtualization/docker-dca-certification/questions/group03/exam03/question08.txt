Which of the following is the only instruction that may precede FROM instruction in Dockerfile?

A)
RUN

B)
CMD

C)
ARG

D)
EXPOSE





































Answer C

ARG defines a variable that users can pass at build-time & itâ€™s the only instruction that may precede FROM instruction.
ARG is the only instruction that may precede FROM instruction in a Dockerfile.

Option A is incorrect as RUN instruction will execute any commands in a new layer on top of the current image and commit the results & cannot precede FROM instruction.

Option B is incorrect as its main purpose is to provide defaults for an execution container and cannot precede FROM instruction.

Option D is incorrect as it informs Docker that the container listens on the specified network ports at runtime & cannot precede FROM instruction.
