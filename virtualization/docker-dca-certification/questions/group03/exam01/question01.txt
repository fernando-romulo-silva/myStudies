You created a docker swarm cluster using “docker swarm init” command. 
After creating the swarm cluster you got a command using which you could add a worker to your cluster. 
But you  have lost that command and now you want to add new workers to your cluster. 
How would you do that?

A)
docker swarm init-token worker

B)
docker swarm init-token manager

C)
docker swarm join-token manager

D)
docker swarm join-token worker


































Answer D

Option A is incorrect because there is no such subcommand “init-token”

Option B is incorrect because there is no such subcommand “init-token”

Option C is incorrect because we need join-token for worker

Option D is correct because of

1) Get the token
 
$ docker swarm join-token worker


2) Join the cluster 
    
$ docker swarm join \
    --token SWMTKN-1-3pu6hszjas19xyp7ghgosyx9k8atbfcr8p2is99znpy26u2lkl-7p73s1dx5in4tatdymyhg9hu2 \
