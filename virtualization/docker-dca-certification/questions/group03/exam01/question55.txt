Which of the following lvm mode should a production host using the devicemapper as a storage driver use?

A)
loop-lvm

B)
overlay

C)
direct-lvm

D)
zfs





































Answer C

Option B and D are incorrect because they are not an lvm mode. 
Overlay is a storage driver in docker whereas zfs is a filesystem.

Option A is incorrect because loop-lvm is used for testing. 
It allows files on local disk to be read form and written to as if they were an actual physical disk or block device.

This means that the IO operations can be slow and resource intensive, it can also introduce race conditions.

However, it can be used for rapid-testing and identifying basic setup issues with the devicemapper driver.

Option C is correct since direct-lvm mode is meant to be used in production.
