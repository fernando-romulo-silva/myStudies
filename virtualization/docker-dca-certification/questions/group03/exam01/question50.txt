C)
Create a new secret, update the service to use this new secret , delete the old secret

D)
Create a new secret, create a new service with this new secret, delete old secret and old service



































Answer C

Secrets are immutable in docker swarm. 
This means they cannot be modified. 
So if you want to make any modification to a secret then you have to create a new secret file.

Having said that, the current sequence for updating a secret is - to first create a new secret (because we canâ€™t update an existing one), 
attach the new secret to the service by updating the service - (this would require the service to restart - docker swarm would take care of that) 
and then delete the old secret.
