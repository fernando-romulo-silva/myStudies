Answer A

A grant is made up of subject, role, and resource set.

Grants define which users can access what resources in what way. 
Grants are effectively Access Control Lists (ACLs), and when grouped together, they provide comprehensive access policies for an entire organization.

Only an administrator can manage grants, subjects, roles, and access to resources.
