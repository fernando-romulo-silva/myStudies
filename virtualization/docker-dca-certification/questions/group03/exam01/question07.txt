You are running a service called 'webserver'. 
You need to increase the number of replicas of that service to 5. 
Which of the following commands would achieve this?

A)
docker swarm scale webserver=5

B)
docker service scale webserver=5

C)
docker service --replicas=5 webserver

D)
docker swarm --replicas=5 webserver



































Answer B

The scale command enables you to scale one or more replicated services either up or down to the desired number of replicas.

Run the following command to change the desired state of the service running in the swarm:

docker service scale <SERVICE-ID>=<NUMBER-OF-TASKS>

Ex:

$ docker service scale helloworld=5
