Answer: C

Option C is wrong. A stack is a collection of services that runs on swarm.Option C is wrong. 
A stack is a collection of services that runs on swarm.

Option A is right. You use the same file for docker-compose and for docker stack.

Option B is right. You must use API Version 3.0 or higher in order to use it in a swarm.

Option D is right. Docker would raise a warning when you bring the service up using the docker-compose command in a swarm-enabled node. 
However, the service will run only on that lone instance.
