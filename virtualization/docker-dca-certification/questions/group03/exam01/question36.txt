Bob runs a container with --net=host, which of the following will NOT true? 
There are already multiple containers running on the host

A)
The container will use host network namespace and the network interfaces and IP stack of the host

B)
All containers in the host network are able to communicate with each other on the host interfaces

C)
Because they are using the host networking namespace, two containers are able to bind to the same TCP port

D)
From a networking standpoint this is equivalent to multiple processes running on a host without containers




































Answer C

Any two processes running on same networking namespace can’t bind to the same port. 
This holds true for host networking namespace as well. 
That’s why Option C is a false statement.
