You had a security issue and you suspect that someone might have got access to the token for adding managers to your cluster. 
Since itâ€™s a major security issue - you need to do something about it to prevent your cluster from being misused. 
What would you do?

A)
Rotate your join-token for both worker and manager

B)
Rotate your join-token only for manager and it will automatically rotate it for worker

C)
Rotate your join-token only for for worker and it will automatically rotate for manager

D)
You need not worry about it - docker swarm by default rotate token every hour



































Answer A

Option B is incorrect because just rotating manager token would not rotate worker token automatically

Option C is incorrect because just rotating worker token would not rotate token for manager

Option D is incorrect because this is not a default docker behaviour
