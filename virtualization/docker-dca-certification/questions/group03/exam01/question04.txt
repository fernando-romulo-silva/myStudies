Which of the following statements is NOT TRUE about replicated service in docker?

A)
A service running in a replicated mode may not run in all nodes.

B)
For replicated services, the scheduler places one task on each available node that meets 
the service’s placement constraints and resource requirements.

C)
If you don’t specify a mode, the service defaults to replicated

D)
For replicated services you can specify number of replica tasks




































Answer B

Option B is correct because its a false statement. 
This statement is true for global services not replicated services.

For “global services”, the scheduler places one task on each available node that meets the service’s placement constraints and resource requirements. 
For replicated services the scheduler can place multiple tasks on same host and it might not even place a single task on a node which meets the constraints, 
it’s all up to the scheduler. Finally, you can have more nodes than the number of specified replicas for a service. 
For example, let's supposed you have 5 nodes in your swarm. You decided to scale your service to run 3 replicas. 
Because of that, not all nodes will run your task.

Option A is incorrect because its a true statement

Option C is incorrect because it is a true statement. 
The default service mode is replicated.

Option D is incorrect because its a true statement.
