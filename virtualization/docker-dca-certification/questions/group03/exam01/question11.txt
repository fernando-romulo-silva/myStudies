Which of the following statements is NOT TRUE regarding to running a container vs running a service?


A)
You can run multiple copies of a container image in both cases

B)
You can achieve fault-tolerance running mutiple copies 
of a container image without the need to run them as a service

C)
Running your container image as a service eliminates the needs of setting up a load balancer

D)
Docker Secrets is available while running your container image as a service.



































Answer B

B is wrong. 
If your Docker host has issues that prevent the Docker engine from running, you cannot start your container. 
Running your service in Docker Swarm with multiple nodes would achieve fault-tolerance, as the managers will be responsible
to distribute your workloads across the swarm nodes and create a task on another node in case one swarm 
node goes down or if the container dies unexpectedly.

A is right. You can run multiple copies of a container. 
However, if your service requires an ingress port, you have to expose a different port in your host machine.

C is right. 
You can create a service that exposes a port and any members of the swarm will route the traffic to the target container throught the overlay network.

D is right. 
Secrets are only available in the swarm configuration.
