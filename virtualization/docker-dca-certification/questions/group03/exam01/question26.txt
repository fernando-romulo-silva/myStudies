One fine morning while configuring docker host bob got stuck with a problem. 
Docker service just wouldn’t start. After checking logs Bob found the following error. 
When would an error like this arise?

unable to configure the Docker daemon with file /etc/docker/daemon.json:
the following directives are specified both as a flag and in the configuration
file: hosts: (from flag: [unix:///var/run/docker.sock], from file: [tcp://127.0.0.1:23]


A)
After configuring the same flag in both daemon.json and dockerd flags

B)
After upgrading docker

C)
After running docker without systemd

D)
After killing dockerd process and restarting it manually






























Answer A

This error arises after conflicting configuration. 

Error says that the value of “hosts” has been specified differently in both /etc/docker/daemon.json 
file as well as in the argument given to “dockerd”
