Which of the following is true about Entrypoint of an Image?

B)
It’s a command that will be executed anytime a container is created using the image

C)
It is defined while creating the image and cannot be overridden

D)
Entrypoint must be a script





































Answer B

Entrypoint is used to provide a command which will run when the image is run by anyone. 
It is defined with “ENTRYPOINT” command in the Dockerfile. 

Option A is not correct, Entrypoint is not a script. 
It might be a command which executes a script but irrespective of this it need not be run manually by the person using the image.

Option C is incorrect because it can be overridden with “--entrypoint” flag while using “docker run” command

Option D is incorrect because Entrypoint is a command not a script.
