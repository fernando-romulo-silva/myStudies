You created a docker swarm with default address pool as this: 10.0.0.0/16

Now when you run the following command to create an overlay network - what IP subnet will be allocated to this overlay network?

NOTE: X can be any value starting from 0 to 255

COMMAND: docker network create -d overlay --attachable my-attachable-overlay

A)
10.0.X.0/24

B)
10.1.X.0/24

C)
10.2.X.0/24

D)
10.3.X.0/24































Answer A

Docker allocates subnet addresses from the address ranges specified by the --default-addr-pool option. 

For example, a command line option --default-addr-pool 10.10.0.0/16 indicates that Docker will allocate subnets from that /16 address range.
 
If --default-addr-pool-mask-len were unspecified or set explicitly to 24, this would result in 256 /24 networks of the form 10.10.X.0/24.
