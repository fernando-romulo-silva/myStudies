A)
defined

B)
none

C)
some

D)
all





































Answer D

Containers running on same Docker network are essentially part of the same bridge and have connectivity to all ports of each other.

The default network that every container uses is the default 'bridge' network and the containers can communicate with each other by IP address, 
but not by hostname.

The --link (that comes with 'docker container run --link') indeed allows you to communicate with another container in a secure 
way without the need to expose ports, but this option should be removed from Docker soon in favour 
of create a user-defined networks and associate with the desired containers

I guess it still important to know about the --link feature
