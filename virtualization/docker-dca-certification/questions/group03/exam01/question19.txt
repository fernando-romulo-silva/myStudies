You have the following values in your Dockerfile

ENV abc=hello
ENV abc=bye def=$abc
ENV ghi=$abc

What is the correct output of command “echo $abc $def $ghi” run inside the container?

A)
hello bye hello

B)
bye bye hello

C)
bye hello bye

D)
hello hello bye































Answer C

Environment variable substitution will use the same value for each variable throughout the entire instruction. 

However, "ghi" will have a value of 'bye' because it is not part of the same instruction that set "abc" to 'bye'.
