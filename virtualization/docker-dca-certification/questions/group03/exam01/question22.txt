Which of the following statement is correct? 
Pick exactly two statements


A)
Image is a collection of immutable layers whereas container is a running instance of an image

B)
Container can exist without the image but image cannot exist without container

C)
Only one container can be spawned from a given image at a time

D)
If multiple containers are spawned from the same image then they all use the same copy of image in memory



































The correct answers are Option A and D.

Option A is correct. Image consists of layers which are immutable. 
Container is a running instance of an image.

Option D is correct because when we spawn multiple containers from a same image - only a single copy of the image is loaded on memory. 
Each container has its own Read and Write layer to accommodate its local changes.

Option B is incorrect because containers cannot exist without an image. 
We can spawn a container using an image.

Option C is incorrect because we can spawn multiple containers from a single image.
