Bob wants to debug some issues happening with his docker daemon running on a linux system, 
he made some changes to his docker daemon using daemon.json file, 
now he wants docker to reload those changes but he can’t restart docker because he has something critical running on it, 
which of the following might help him achieve that?

A)
sudo kill -9 $(pid of dockerd)

B)
sudo kill -1 $(pid of dockerd)

C)
sudo systemctl restart $(pid of dockerd)

D)
sudo kill -SIGHUP $(pidof dockerd)


































Answer D

sudo kill -SIGHUP $(pidof dockerd) makes the dockerd reload it’s configuration without killing the docker daemon.
