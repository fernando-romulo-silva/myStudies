Overlay networks cannot be created if docker engine is not a manager node in docker swarm?

A)
True

B)
False











































Answer is A

The correct answer is: True

Overlay networks canâ€™t exist if docker engine is not a part of a swarm. 
So to create overlay network being a manager node in a swarm is a necessary condition.

If we try creating overlay networks from a non-manager node we get the following error:

$ docker network create -d overlay test-network

Error response from daemon: Cannot create a multi-host network from a worker node. 
Please create the network from a manager node.
