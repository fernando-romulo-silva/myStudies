Given the following Dockerfile below:

FROM ubuntu
ENTRYPOINT  ["exec_entry", "p1_entry"]
CMD exec-cmd p1_cmd

What is the command that gets executed when someone runs the image built using this Dockerfile?

A)
exec_entry p1_entry /bin/sh -c “ exec-cmd p1_cmd “

B)
exec_entry p1_entry exec_cmd p1_cmd

C)
exec_entry p1_entry

D)
/bin/sh -c “ exec-cmd p1_cmd “

E)
/bin/sh -c “exec_entry p1_entry” /bin/sh -c “ exec-cmd p1_cmd “




























Answer A

Entrypoint is using exec form whereas CMD is using shell form. 
The composition of the two gives exec_entry p1_entry /bin/sh -c “ exec-cmd p1_cmd “
