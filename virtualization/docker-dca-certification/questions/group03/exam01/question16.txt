Which of the following patterns would exclude all Python byte-code 
files from being copied during the Docker image creation process?

A)
**.pyc

B)
**/*.pyc

C)
*.pyc

D)
/*.pyc




































The correct answer is Option B

Beyond Goâ€™s filepath.Match rules, Docker also supports a special wildcard string ** that matches any number of directories (including zero). 

For example, **/*.go will exclude all files that end with .go that are found in all directories, including the root of the build context.
