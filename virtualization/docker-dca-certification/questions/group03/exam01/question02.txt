Which of the following statement below is NOT TRUE about docker-compose?

A)
docker-compose is well suited for development environments

B)
docker-compose can not be used to create new container images

C)
docker-compose will bring up services as specified in docker-compose.yml

D)
docker-compose can be used with docker swarm to run services across different workers.




































Answer D

D is wrong. 
You can actually run docker-compose on a Swarm, but the Swarm will raise a warning informing you that the service you are creating with 
docker-compose command will be run on a single node rather than running in multiple nodes (as a service). 

So, D is wrong becasue it will run in a single swarm worker and D explicity says it would run in multiple workers.

To run a docker-compose.yaml in a Swarm, you will use the regular 'docker' command.


A is right because the actual purpose of 'docker-compose' command is to enable a developer to easily create 
a set of services and resources needed to run his/her application on Docker.

C is right because the actual purpose of 'docker-compose' will be this.

B is right because Docker composer can actually build images based on a Dockerfile you reference in your docker-compose.yml. 
You cannot, however, create an image, because that will be the purpose of the Dockerfile, not the docker-compose.yml. 

Docker compose build images as necessary if you don't have that particular image built previously.
