The processes spawned by a container are run as what user by default?

A)
any non root user

B)
root

C)
guest-user

D)
user who executes docker run command





































Answer B

By default all processes executed inside docker container run as root user on the host. 

But this root user has very limited privileges and hence is relatively safe.

But to decrease security risks - itâ€™s safer to  use --user flag to execute the process as a non root user.

$ docker run --user=demo_user -ti custom_image bash
