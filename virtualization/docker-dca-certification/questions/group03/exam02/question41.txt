Which of the following networks are created by default after initialising a docker swarm? “docker swarm init”

A)
docker_gwbridge and ingress

B)
docker_bridge and overlay

C)
bridge and ingress

D)
only docker_gwbridge





































Answer  A

B) There is no such auto created network as docker_bridge or overlay

C) "bridge" is the default network created by docker-ce for communication between containers within the host. 
    It is a private network which is created by default. 
    There is no such network named “overlay” created by default
        
D) "bridge" is the default network created by docker-ce for communication between containers within the host. 
   "Ingress" is the default overlay network created by docker swarm for communication between containers deployed across different docker hosts
   
By default docker creates docker_gwbridge and ingress network
Docker uses docker_gwbridge network to help in provisioning overlay networks whereas it uses ingress networks for publishing/load balancing application ports.
