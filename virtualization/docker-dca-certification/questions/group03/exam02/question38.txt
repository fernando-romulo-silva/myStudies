You built this amazing image using a Dockerfile on your system. 
You initially tagged it as “myimage”. 
Now you need to push this to a registry which resides at “myregistry.com” and is running at port 9999. 
What tag and push would you do to achieve it?


A)
docker push --registry myregistry.com:9999 myimage

B)
docker tag myimage myregistry.com:9999/myimage && docker push myregistry.com:9999/myimage

C)
docker tag myregistry.com:9999/myimage myimage  && docker push myregistry.com:9999/myimage

D)
docker tag myimage myregistry.com/myimage && docker push -p 9999 myregistry.com/myimage

































Answer  B

Image has to be tagged in format -> <domain>:<port>/imagename

So first you have to tag image:

$ docker tag myimage myregistry.com:9999/myimage

Then you have to push it

$ docker push myregistry.com:9999/myimage
