By default, removing a container also removes the volumes attached to it.

A)
True

B)
False











































Answer B

Removing a container doesnâ€™t remove the volume attached to it. 
This is the default behaviour, as containers must be ephemeral as possible.

Volumes are persistent attachabled storage that holds data in a directory in the host machine and a mounted volume inside a Docker container.
