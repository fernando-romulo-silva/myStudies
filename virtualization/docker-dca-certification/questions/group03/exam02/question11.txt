In which of the following circumstances a service WILL NOT end up in a PENDING state?

A)
If you created a global service but set a placement preference

B)
If no node in the swarm has the required amount of resources

C)
If a service cannot meet a constraint rule set during the creation step

D)
If all worker nodes are unavailable and you only have manager nodes available





































Answer  D

Option D is correct a task can be run on both worker and managers.

Option A is incorrect because placement preferences are ignored if a service is a global type.

Option B is incorrect because if there is no spare resource available such as memory, 
the service will be in pending state until it finds a freed resource in any node.

Option C is incorrect because if placement constraints are not met then the task will go into pending state 
till the cluster can meet the placement constraints.
