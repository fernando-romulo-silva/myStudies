Which of the following is true about --privileged mode while running docker container?

A)
It enables all kernel capabilities for the container

B)
It increases security of a container

C)
It increases the isolation of processes running inside container

D)
It disables privilege escalation





































Answer  A

By using the  – – privileged flag you basically enable all kernel capabilities, 
which enables a process running within a Docker container to bypass most of the controls such as kernel namespaces and cgroups limitations.
 
In other words, by adding this flag you give an attacker an easy path to break out of the container and to compromise the whole host.
