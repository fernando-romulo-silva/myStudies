Alice created a custom Docker image for a Java web application called "voteapp" which contains a large potion of commands in order to build the application. 
She pushed this image to the registry and deleted the Docker file by accident. 
She doens't know what are the steps needs to build this image back. 
Which of the following commands would help her to describe the steps she took in order to build this image?

A)
docker inspect voteapp:latest

B)
docker image history voteapp:latest

C)
docker image describe voteapp:latest

D)
docker image ls


































Answer  B

Option B is correct because “docker image history” command shows the commands used in the Dockerfile to build the image. 
You might need the --no-trunc option to see the full command, as the output might be truncated to fit the screen.

Option A is not correct because with "docker inspect" we can only see the image info like OS, Architecture, Layers, Author, and etc. 
We have no reference regarding the build stages.


Option C is incorrect because this is an invalid command.

Option D is incorrect because it will list the images available locally.
