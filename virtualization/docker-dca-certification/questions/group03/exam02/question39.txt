You have an image which has

ENTRYPOINT [“/bin/bash”, “-c”,  “ping”]

CMD [“localhost”]

Image name is myimage. How would you run this image to ping google.com

A)
docker run -it myimage ping google.com

B)
docker run -it myimage google.com

C)
docker run -it myimage /bin/bash -c ping google.com

D)
None of these or All of these































Answer  B

Entrypoint is /bin/bash -c ping , default CMD is localhost.

So if we just run:

$ docker run -it myimage

It will execute : /bin/bash -c ping localhost


We can override the default CMD by providing our own cmd after “myimage” :

$ docker run -it myimage google.com

It will execute: /bin/bash -c ping google.com
