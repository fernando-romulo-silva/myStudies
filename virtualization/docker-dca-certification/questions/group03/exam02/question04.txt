Bob is running a docker swarm cluster with multiple manager nodes. 
Bob needs to remove one the manager nodes from the cluster permanently. 
Bob has access to this manager node. What is the safest way for him to remove a manager node from the cluster?

A)
Simply shut down the server and let the Raft quorum decides to remove it permanently from the swarm

B)
Run "docker swarm leave" on the specific node

C)
Firstly demote the manager node to a worker and then remove it using "docker swarm leave"

D)
Stop the docker service on this specific manager node. 
Wait until its status change to 'Unreachable' by checking the status on another manager node. 
Once it disappears from the list of manager nodes, you can safely shut down this node.

































Answer C

C is correct because this is the correct and safest way to remove a manager from a swarm.

A is incorrect because the purpose of a raft quorum is to decide which manager node is a leader. 
The manager will still show as 'active' in the swarm, but the manager status will be 'Unreachable'

B is incorrect because only a worker node can leave a swarm with no restriction. 
If a manager node tries to leave a swarm, the command will fail because it will state you are a manager. 
Therefore you must demote this node to a worker so the swarm and them you can leave the swarm as a worker. 
If the current manager is the leader, it will successfully auto-demote itself and the raft quorum will decide which manager node will be the new leader.  

D is incorrect because the manager will still show as 'active' in the swarm, but the manager status will be 'Unreachable'.
