Pick ALL storage drivers from the list below which operate at block level?

overlay2, aufs, btrfs, zfs, devicemapper

A)
overlay, aufs, zfs

B)
aufs, btrfs, zfs

C)
devicemapper, btrfs, zfs

D)
aufs, btrfs, zfs, overlay



































Answer  C

* overlay2, aufs, and overlay all operate at the file level rather than the block level. 
  This uses memory more efficiently, but the containerâ€™s writable layer may grow quite large in write-heavy workloads.
  
* Block-level storage drivers such as devicemapper, btrfs, and zfs perform better for write-heavy workloads (though not as well as Docker volumes).
    
* For lots of small writes or containers with many layers or deep filesystems,overlay may perform better than overlay2, 
  but consumes more inodes, which can lead to inode exhaustion.

* btrfs and zfs require a lot of memory.

* zfs is a good choice for high-density workloads such as PaaS.
