Which of the following commands can take a tar file as an argument and add the extracted content into the image automatically?

A)
COPY

B)
ADD

C)
ADD and COPY both

D)
None of these





































The correct answer is Option B.

COPY and ADD are both Dockerfile instructions that serve similar purposes. 
They let you copy files from a specific location into a Docker image.
Ex:

  FROM eclipse-temurin:17.0.1_12-jre-alpine as builder
  WORKDIR /application
  
  ARG JAR_FILE=target/*.jar
  COPY ${JAR_FILE} application.jar
  
  ADD src/main/tesseract/eng.tar.xz tesseract/tessdata/eng.tar.xz
  

RUN java -Djarmode=layertools -jar application.jar extract

COPY takes in a src and destination. 
It only lets you copy in a local file or directory from your host (the machine building the Docker image) into the Docker image itself.

ADD lets you do that too, but it also supports 2 other sources. 
First, you can use a URL instead of a local file / directory. Secondly, you can extract a tar file from the source directly into the destination.
