Which one of the following is the preferred storage driver, for all currently supported Linux distributions?

A)
aufs

B)
overlay2

C)
btrfs

D)
devicemapper





































Answer  B

Option B is correct. Overlay2 is the the default and preferred storage driver in most modern Linux operating systems.
 
Option A is incorrect. Aufs is generally preferred storage driver in cases where overlay2 is not supported, e.g. in ubuntu 18.04

Option C is incorrect. btrfs and zfs storage drivers are used if they are the backing filesystem (the filesystem of the host on which Docker is installed). 
These filesystems allow for advanced options, such as creating “snapshots”, but require more maintenance and setup.

Option D is incorrect. device-mapper is generally preferred when we want to take advantage of LVM.
