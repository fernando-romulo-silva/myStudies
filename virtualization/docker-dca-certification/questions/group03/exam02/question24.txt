If we don't specify a tag then by convention which tag is pulled while running docker pull command?

A)
production

B)
staging

C)
latest

D)
master





































Answer C

1) production tag can be manually created/specified but it is not auto generated.

2) staging tag can be manually created/specified but it is not auto generated.
   This is the correct option. “latest” is the default tag.
   
3) Image versions can be specified manually but it is not auto generated.

The default tag to pull is latest.
