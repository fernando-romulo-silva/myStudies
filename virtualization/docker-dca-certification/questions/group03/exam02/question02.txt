What is the correct order a system administrator should follow for creating a backup policy for the Docker Enterprise Edition?

A)
swarm, ucp, dtr

B)
dtr, ucp, swarm

C)
ucp, dtr, swarm

D)
swarm, dtr, ucp





































The correct answer is Option A.

You only take backup of a single master, since the entire state of the cluster is present with all the masters with the help of a distributed storage.

Docker swarm manager node state the manager logs which have the state of the entire cluster. 
UCP stores configurations, access control, certificates, metrics data, etc.

UCP doesn't store information about how many services are running and where they are running - that data is managed by swarm.

On the other hand DTR only stores images and some other configurations relevant to the images.

The sequence of backup above is recommended by Docker to attain best results during recovery.

For example if UCP is backed up before swarm - then we will lose some swarm metrics data. 
Which were collected during the interval of backup of UCP.

Whereas if we backup swarm first and then UCP then we will not miss out on any metrics gathered.
