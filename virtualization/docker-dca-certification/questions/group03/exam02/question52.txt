Which of the following statements is NOT true?

By default all files created inside a container are stored on a writable container layer. This means that:

A)
The data persists when that container no longer exists

B)
Two different containers can’t share the data present in their writable layer

C)
A container’s writable layer is tightly coupled to the host machine where the container is running. 
You can’t easily move the data somewhere else

D)
Writing into a container’s writable layer requires a storage driver to manage the filesystem.


































Answer  A

When a container is deleted - all data present in it’s writable layer is also lost. 
To prevent this data loss we can use volumes.

Option B is incorrect because its a true statement. 
Containers writable layers are separated using different mount namespaces and hence they can’t share it.

Option C is incorrect because it’s a true statement

Option D is incorrect because it’s a true statement
