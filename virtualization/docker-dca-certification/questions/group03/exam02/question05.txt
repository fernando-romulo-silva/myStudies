You are running a Docker Swarm with autolock feature enabled. 
Which of the following statement below is NOT TRUE regarding to autolock feature in Docker?

A)
You need the unlock key in case one of the manager node was restarted

B)
The autolock feature was created to encrypt secrets in the Raft logs securely

C)
A worker node can join in a cluster without the need of the autolock key

D)
If you lost the unlock key, you must create a new one from the manager node by rotating the unlock key.




































Answer  D

D is incorrect. You can run 'docker swarm unlock-key' to retrieve the current key.

A is correct. This is because the manager stores the raft logs encrypted at rest and in-memory.  

B is correct. Altough you can work with secrets without the autolock, your secrets will be stored unencrypted at the manager node. 
If the manager node becomes compromised, this sensitive data can be read from the disk.

C is correct. Node will join as usual because the manager handles the secret in memory, not the worker.
