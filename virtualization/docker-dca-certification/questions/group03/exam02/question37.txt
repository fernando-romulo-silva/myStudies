Which of the following commands will deploy nginx only on 
worker nodes of the swarm so that it is accessible externally on port 8000

NOTE: By external connectivity means the nginx can be accessed on http://WORKER_IP:8000

A)
docker service create -p 8000 --constraint node.role=worker nginx

B)
docker service create -p 8000 --placement-pref node.role=worker nginx

C)
docker service create -p 8000:80 --constraint node.role=worker nginx

D)
docker service create -p 8000:80 --placement-pref node.role=worker nginx


































Answer C

External port 8000 has to be mapped to internal port 80 because nginx web server runs on port 80 inside the container. 
Also --constraint flag will ensure that the services get deployed only on worker nodes.

Option A is incorrect because “-p 8000” will expose port 8000 inside the container on a random port in the swarm. 
Also even if we hit that external port we would not get any webpage back because we are exposing port 8000 and not port 80.

Option B is incorrect because “--placement-pref” will give a preference for deploying the service on worker nodes but we don’t want preference here, 
we want to ensure that it “must” be deployed only on worker nodes. Also “-p 8000” is incorrect
