Which of the follow is true about MTLS?

A)
MTLS ensures that client can authenticate the identity of the server

B)
MTLS ensures that both client and server authenticate each other’s identities

C)
MTLS ensures that server can authenticate the identity of the client

D)
MTLS is used by Docker registry for safe transmission of images





































Answer  B

MTLS stands for mutual TLS. 

Normal TLS just ensures that the client can verify authenticity of the server but in MTLS both the 
sender and receiver verify each other’s identities using the same model as TLS.
 
MTLS is used in docker swarm to safely transmit data between nodes.

Option D is incorrect, Docker registry uses simple TLS for transmission of images.
