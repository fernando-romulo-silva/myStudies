Which of the following is default network in docker?

A)
bridge

B)
macvlan

C)
host

D)
overlay





































Answer  A

bridge is the correct answer.

bridge: The default network driver. 
If you don’t specify a driver, this is the type of network you are creating. 
Bridge networks are usually used when your applications run in standalone containers that need to communicate.

host: For standalone containers, remove network isolation between the container and the Docker host, and use the host’s networking directly. 
host is only available for swarm services on Docker 17.06 and higher.

overlay: Overlay networks connect multiple Docker daemons together and enable swarm services to communicate with each other. 
You can also use overlay networks to facilitate communication between a swarm service and a standalone container, 
or between two standalone containers on different Docker daemons.
This strategy removes the need to do OS-level routing between these containers

macvlan: Macvlan networks allow you to assign a MAC address to a container, making it appear as a physical device on your network. 
The Docker daemon routes traffic to containers by their MAC addresses. 
Using the macvlan driver is sometimes the best choice when dealing with legacy applications that expect to be directly connected to the physical network, 
rather than routed through the Docker host’s network stack.

none: For this container, disable all networking. 
Usually used in conjunction with a custom network driver. 
none is not available for swarm services.
