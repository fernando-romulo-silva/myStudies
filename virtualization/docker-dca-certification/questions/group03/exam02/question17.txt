C)

Answer  A

Option A is correct. "-s" flag is used for this purpose.

$ docker ps -s
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                         COMMAND                  CREATED       STATUS              PORTS                                                           NAMES                       SIZE
866ac42175df   image-converter-service-iso   "dumb-init java --enâ€¦"   13 days ago   Up About a minute   5000/tcp, 5090/tcp, 0.0.0.0:8080->8080/tcp, :::8080->8080/tcp   image-converter-service-1   6.45MB (virtual 502MB)


Option B is incorrect. "-s" flag is not valid in this scope.

Option C is incorrect. This will return the size of the container image. 
The question is about of a running container.

Option D is incorrect. This does not show the disk usage by container.
