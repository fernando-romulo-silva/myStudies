Which of the following is NOT a supported storage backend for a centralized storage in DTR?

A)
Openstack Swift

B)
NFS

C)
Google Cloud Storage

D)
AWS EBS volumes






































Answer  D

Because EBS volumes are storage drives that are attached into a single AWS EC2 instances. 

Altough anyone could argue that you can take snapshots from a EBS volume and attach this snapshot into other AWS EC2 instances, 
it DOES NOT act a centralized storage backend.
 
For such purpose, it is the AWS S3 and it is supported by DTR.
