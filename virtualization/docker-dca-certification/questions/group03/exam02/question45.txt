Which of the following is NOT a good security practice?

A)
Pull image by hash in order to uniquely identify an image and to ensure it’s integrity

B)
Use a stripped down base image

C)
Execute the process as a user with limited privileges

D)
Use --privileged flag while running containers to ensure more security





































Answer  D

By using the  – – privileged flag you basically enable all kernel capabilities, 
which enables a process running within a Docker container to bypass most of the controls such as kernel namespaces and cgroups limitations. 
In other words, by adding this flag you give an attacker an easy path to break out of the container and to compromise the whole host.

Option A is incorrect because it’s a true statement 
Docker uses latest tag is default while pulling an image. 
Pulling images by hash ensure that you are pulling the exact image that you intend do so in case of a security breach someone might 
have uploaded a malformed latest tag but if you pull image by hash you will get the image you intend to.

Option B is incorrect because it’s a true statement 
Using a slim base image decreases the possible attack surface

Option C is incorrect because it’s a true statement
It’s a good process to execute process as user with limited privileges
