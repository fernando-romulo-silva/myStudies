Which of the following commands can use a remote URL to get files inside image?

A)
COPY

B)
ADD

C)
ADD and COPY both

D)
DOWNLOAD





































Answer B

COPY and ADD are both Dockerfile instructions that serve similar purposes. 
They let you copy files from a specific location into a Docker image.

COPY takes in a src and destination. 
It only lets you copy in a local file or directory from your host (the machine building the Docker image) into the Docker image itself.

ADD lets you do that too, but it also supports 2 other sources. 
First, you can use a URL instead of a local file / directory. Secondly, you can extract a tar file from the source directly into the destination.
