services

D)

Answer C

Docker Stack sits at a higher level than Docker containers and helps to manage the orchestration of multiple containers across several machines. 

Docker Stack is run across a Docker Swarm (SERVICES), which is essentially a group of machines running the Docker daemon, 
which are grouped together, essentially pooling resources.
