You are running a Docker Trusted Registry in your swarm with 5 replicas. 
You also maintain a routine backup of this service. 
One day, some worker nodes failed. 
Because of that, some services were affected, including 2 replicas of the Docker Trusted Registry. 
Do you have to start a restore process from the backup files?

A)
True

B)
False







































Answer B

A DTR with 5 replicas can sustain 2 unhealthy nodes. 

All you have to do is either kill the unhealthy nodes and let the swarm creates another two replicas 
or add new nodes to your swarm and let the swarm creates the 2 missing tasks.
