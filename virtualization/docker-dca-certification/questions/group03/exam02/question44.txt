Bob wants to test an untrusted docker image which has a bug due to which it starts consuming memory 
rapidly which causes other programs on the system to run out of memory and crash. 

Bob wants to run the container and limit the max memory it can to be 512MB

Which of the following can bob use while running a container to deal with this problem?

A)
docker run --limit 512m

B)
docker run --limit 512

C)
docker run -m 512m

D)
docker run -m 512
































Answer  C

To limit the maximum amount of memory usage for a container, add the --memory option to the docker run command. 
Alternatively, you can use the shortcut -m.

$ docker run -it --memory="1g" ubuntu

Option A is incorrect because --limit is not a valid flag

Option B is incorrect because --limit is not a valid flag

Option D is incorrect because -m 512 only assigns 512 bytes but bob wants to assign 512MB
