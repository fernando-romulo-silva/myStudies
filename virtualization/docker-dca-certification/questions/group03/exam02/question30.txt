Which of the following options would enable to SSH into a running Docker container named 'nginx'?

A)
docker exec -it nginx /bin/sh

B)
docker inspect webserver

C)
docker run -it nginx /bin/sh

D)
docker ssh -it nginx /bin/sh





































The correct answer is Option A.

On option A, "docker exec -it nginx /bin/sh" will create an interactive session attached to the STDIN and with a TTY.

Option B is incorrect because this will bring detailed information about the running container.

Option C is incorrect because this will create ANOTHER container using "nginx" image and you would switch 
the starting command from being the nginx daemon to be a shell attached to the STDIN. 
As soon as you logout from this container, the container stops itself.

Option D is incorrect because there is no such command.
