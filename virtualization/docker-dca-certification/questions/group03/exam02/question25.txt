C)

D)

Answer  A

Docker swarm allows managing docker stack from manager nodes only.

If we try deploying a docker stack from non manager node we get the following error:

$ docker stack deploy -c docker-compose.yml newapp

This node is not a swarm manager. 
Use "docker swarm init" or "docker swarm join" to connect this node to swarm and try again
