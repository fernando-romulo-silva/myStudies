Which is the default location of a config file when using Docker config?

A)
/run/config/

B)
/var/run/

C)
/

D)
/config/





































Answer C

When you grant a newly-created or running service access to a config, the config is mounted as a file in the container. 
The location of the mount point within the container defaults to / in Linux containers. 

In Windows containers, configs are all mounted into C:\ProgramData\Docker\configs and symbolic 
links are created to the desired location, which defaults to C:\.

Configs can be used only with docker swarm
