Which of the following options are available to run a single container?

A)
published port, user, log driver, restart policy

B)
published port, user, log driver, placement constraints

C)
published port, volume, secrets, log driver

D)
volume, secrets, log driver, memory limit





































Answer  A

Option A is correct

Option B is incorrect because we can't specify placement constraints while running a single container. 
Placement constraints can be specified while running a service.

Option C is incorrect because we can't specify secrets while running a single container

Option D is incorrect because we can't specify secrets while running a container.

Regarding to secrets, it is only available on the Docker Swarm and you cannot create a secret on a lone docker execution, 
only if it part of a service.
