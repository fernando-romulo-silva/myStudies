You have a Docker host that is used to build images and tests them. 
You create Docker images using the multi-stage build feature. 
Because of that, there are a large number of dangling images in this host. 
Which of the following commands you could run to only remove the dangling images?

A)
docker rmi --filter dangling=true

B)
docker prune --filter dangling=true

C)
docker system prune

D)
docker image prune --filter dangling=true


































Answer  D

This command is used to clean all the dangling images:

$ docker image prune --filter dangling=true


Option A is incorrect because "--filter" flag is not avaiable on "rmi" sub-command.

Option B is incorrect because  "prune" is not a valid sub-command

Option C is incorrect because "docker system prune" not only removes the dangling images, as well as unused networks, 
stopped containers, and build caches. The question asks to ONLY remove the dangling images and nothing else.
