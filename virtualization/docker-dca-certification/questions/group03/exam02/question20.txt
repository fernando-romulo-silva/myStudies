D)

Answer C

Option C is wrong, because you can select a target build stage.

------
FROM golang:1.16 AS builder
WORKDIR /go/src/github.com/alexellis/href-counter/
RUN go get -d -v golang.org/x/net/html  
COPY app.go    ./
RUN CGO_ENABLED=0 GOOS=linux go build -a -installsuffix cgo -o app .

FROM alpine:latest  
RUN apk --no-cache add ca-certificates
WORKDIR /root/
COPY --from=builder /go/src/github.com/alexellis/href-counter/app ./
CMD ["./app"]
-----  

$ docker build --target builder -t alexellis2/href-counter:latest .


Option A is true. You don't need to maintain different Dockerfile as before.

Option B is true. You can create an image with the sole purpose to build a binary file and one for running a binary file, 
without the need of the compiler nor the development files.

Option D is correct, because you can declare diferrent images and then select which will be your target during the build stage.
