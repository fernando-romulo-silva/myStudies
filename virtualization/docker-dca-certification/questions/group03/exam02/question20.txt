Answer C

Option C is wrong, because you can select a target build stage.

Option A is true. You don't need to maintain different Dockerfile as before.

Option B is true. You can create an image with the sole purpose to build a binary file and one for running a binary file, 
without the need of the compiler nor the development files.

Option D is correct, because you can declare diferrent images and then select which will be your target during the build stage.
