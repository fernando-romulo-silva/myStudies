How can you trigger a image build process directly from a git url?

A)
docker build --remote https://github.com/example/docker-example.git

B)
docker build https://github.com/bocadilloproject/docker-example.git

C)
docker build --from-git https://github.com/bocadilloproject/docker-example.git

D)
docker build --from-url https://github.com/bocadilloproject/docker-example.git





































Answer  B

When the URL parameter points to the location of a Git repository, the repository acts as the build context. 

The system recursively fetches the repository and its submodules. 

The commit history is not preserved. 

A repository is first pulled into a temporary directory on your local host. 

After that succeeds, the directory is sent to the Docker daemon as the context.
