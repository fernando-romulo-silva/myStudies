How can we push a locally built image to a remote registry?

a) We need to know the registry's fully qualified domain name (FQDN) or its IP address.

b) We tag the image with the registry FQDN or IP, the username or group, and the repository where the image will be stored.

c) If the registry uses TLS/SSL certificates, we load its CA in our system to be able to trust them or we can configure it using the insecure-registries key.

d) All of the preceding sentences are correct.
