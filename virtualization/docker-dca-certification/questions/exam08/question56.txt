How can we ensure that the web server Docker service runs one instance of NGINX on all cluster nodes?


a) By using docker service create --type=global --instances=1 --name=webserver --image=nginx:alpine.

b) By using docker service create --mode=global --name=webserver nginx:alpine.

c) UCP can ensure that administrators run any service on all nodes in the cluster with a tick on allow run on manager nodes.

d) docker service create --name=webserver --image=nginx:alpine is enough for executing one instance on all nodes.







































Answer(s) 'b'

Swarm mode has two types of services: replicated and global. 

For replicated services, you specify the number of replica tasks for the swarm manager to schedule onto available nodes. 

For global services, the scheduler places one task on each available node that meets the serviceâ€™s placement constraints and resource requirements.
