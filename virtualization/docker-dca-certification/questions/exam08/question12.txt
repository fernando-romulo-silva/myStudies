Which internal networks are deployed for DTR?

a) docker_gwbridge

b) dtr-ol

c) ingress

d) dtr-internal








































Answer(s) 'b'

To allow containers to communicate, when installing DTR the following networks are created:

* dtr-br (bridge): Allows containers on the same node to communicate with each other in a secure way.

* dtr-ol (overlay):	Allows containers running on different nodes to communicate. 
This network is used in high-availability installations, to allow Etcd and RethinkDB containers to replicate their data.
