Which of the following is true about replicated services?

a) They will run one instance on each node.

b) Only replicated services can be upgraded using the rolling update feature.

c) They can be stopped using the Docker service update: --replicas 0 <SERVICENAME>.

d) We will use Go templates to be able to provide unique resources, such as volumes or hostnames, inside containers to ensure all replicas use their own resources.









































Answer 'c' and 'd'

'a' is wrong because for replicated service, you specify the number of identical tasks you want to run. 

'b' is wrong because of
 
$ docker service update --replicas=5 web
