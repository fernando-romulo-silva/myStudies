ARG variables are persisted into the built image as like the ENV variables.

A)
True

B)
False

B correct

ARG is only available during the build of a Docker image (RUN etc), not after the image is created and containers are started from it (ENTRYPOINT, CMD). 

You can use ARG values to set ENV values to work around that.

ENV values are available to containers, but also RUN-style commands during the Docker build starting with the line where they are introduced.
