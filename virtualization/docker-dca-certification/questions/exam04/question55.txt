Which type of mount is a good choice when you want to store your container's data 
on a remote host or a cloud provider, rather than locally?

​A)​
volumes
​
B)
tempfs
​
C)
bind mounts
​
D)
Regular










































The correct options is 'A'

Volumes are the preferred mechanism for persisting data generated by and used by Docker containers. 

A tmpfs mount is temporary, and only persisted in the host memory. 
When the container stops, the tmpfs mount is removed, and files written there won’t be persisted.
This is useful to temporarily store sensitive files that you don’t want to persist in either the host or the container writable layer
