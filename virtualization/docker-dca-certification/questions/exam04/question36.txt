What is the docker command to connect a running container to an existing user-defined bridge?
​
A)
docker network join
​
B)
docker network attach
​
C)
docker connect network
​
D)
docker network connect







































D is correct

When you create a new container, you can specify one or more --network flags. 
This example connects a Nginx container to the my-net network.

$ docker create --name my-nginx \
  --network my-net \
  --publish 8080:80 \
  nginx:latest
  

To connect a running container to an existing user-defined bridge, use the docker network connect command. 
The following command connects an already-running my-nginx container to an already-existing my-net network:

$ docker network connect my-net my-nginx
