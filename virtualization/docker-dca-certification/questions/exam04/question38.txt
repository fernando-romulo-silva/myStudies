One of the nodes in your existing cluster is logging errors related to the 
storage subsystem it exists on in your infrastructure and needs to be taken offline. 

Which command will allow you to gracefully remove the swarm it is a member of when executed ON the node itself?

A)
​docker swarm unregister

B)
docker swarm leave
​
C)
docker swarm rm
​
D)
None of the above












































B is correct

When you run this command on a worker, that worker leaves gracefully the swarm.
You can use the --force option on a manager to remove it from the swarm.
