$ sudo docker run -i -t alpine /bin/bash
​
B)
$ Sudo docker run container name
​
D)
$ docker PS
​
C)
All of the above





































A is Correct

'$ Sudo docker run container name' is not defined command. 

'$ Sudo docker run -i -t alpine /bin/bash' is the command used for running the image as the container. 

'$ docker PS' is the only command used for seeing all the running containers in docker.
