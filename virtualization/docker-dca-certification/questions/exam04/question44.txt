Arrange the copy-on-write operation steps below in the correct sequence;

A) Any modifications are made to this copy of the file, 
and the container cannot see the read-only copy of the file that exists in the lower layer.

B) Perform a copy_up operation on the first copy of the file that is found, 
to copy the file to the container's writable layer.

C) Search through the image layers for the file to update. 
The process starts at the newest layer and works down to the base layer one layer at a time. 
When results are found, they are added to a cache to speed future operations.
