You can use local file system if you're deploying DTR with high-availability.

A)
TRUE
​
B)
FALSE










































B is correct

By default, DTR creates a volume named dtr-registry-<replica-id> to store your images using the local filesystem. 
You can customize the name and path of the volume used by DTR, using the docker/dtr reconfigure --dtr-storage-volume option.

If you’re deploying DTR with high-availability, you need to use NFS or any other centralized storage backend so that 
all your DTR replicas have access to the same images.
