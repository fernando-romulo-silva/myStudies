Which two commands can get an image from a registry? (select two)

A)
docker pull
​
B)
docker get
​
C)
docker download
​
D)
docker run











































A and D are correct

A - By default, docker pull pulls a single image from the registry. A repository can contain multiple images.

D - The docker run command first creates a writeable container layer over the specified image (download it if doesn't found), 
and then starts it using the specified command.
