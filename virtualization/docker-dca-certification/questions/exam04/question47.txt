A is correct

You can configure DTR to have single sign-on (SSO) with UCP, so that users only have to authenticate once.

At installation time: When installing DTR, use the docker/dtr install --dtr-external-url <url> option to enable SSO. 

After install: In your browser, navigate to the DTR web UI, and choose Settings. 
In the General tab, scroll to Domain & proxies.
