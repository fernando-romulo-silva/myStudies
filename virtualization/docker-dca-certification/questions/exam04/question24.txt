A and B are correct

COPY and ADD are both Dockerfile instructions that serve similar purposes. 
They let you copy files from a specific location into a Docker image.

COPY takes in a src and destruction. It only lets you copy in a local or directory 
from your host (the machine-building the Docker image) into the Docker image itself.
