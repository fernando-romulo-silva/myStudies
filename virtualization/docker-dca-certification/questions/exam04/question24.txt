What is the recommended way to configure the daemon flags and environment variables for your Docker daemon in a platform independent way?

​A)
Set the configuration DOCKER_OPTS in '/etc/default/docker'
​
B)
Set the configuration options in '/etc/docker/daemon.json'
​
C)
Set the configuration options using the ENV variable
​
D)
Using 'docker config' to set the configuration options.










































B is correct

There are two ways to configure the Docker daemon:

Use a JSON configuration file(/etc/docker/daemon.json). 
This is the preferred option, since it keeps all configurations in a single place.

Use flags when starting dockerd. 
You can use both of these options together as long as you don’t specify the same option both as a flag and in the JSON file. 
If that happens, the Docker daemon won’t start and prints an error message.
