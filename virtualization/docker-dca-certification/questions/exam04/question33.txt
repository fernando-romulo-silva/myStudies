Which of the following is NOT true about Raft (docker consensus algorithm)?

​A)
If a quorum is not reached, the system will not process any more requests to schedule additional tasks
​
B)
Raft tolerates (N-2)/2 failures
​
C)
Raft requires a majority or quorum of (N/2) + 1 members
​
D)
If a quorum is not reached, the existing tasks will keep running
​













































B is correct

So a quorum is a majority of managers.
 
To ensure that quorum is achieved in the cluster, swarm managers use something called the Raft Consensus Algorithm. 

Raft tolerates UP TO (N-2)/2 failures and requires a majority or quorum of (N/2)+1 members to agree on values proposed to the cluster. 

This means that in a cluster of 5 Managers running Raft, if 3 nodes are unavailable, 
the system cannot process any more requests to schedule additional tasks.
