Which of the Dockerfile options executes any commands in a new layer on top of the current image and commit the results?
​​
A)
RUN
​
B)
FROM
​
C)
ONBUILD
​
D)
CMD










































A is correct

The RUN directive is used to execute commands during the image build time. 

This will create a new layer on top of the existing layer, execute the specified command, and commit the results to the newly created layer. 

The RUN directive can be used to install the required packages, update the packages, create users and groups, and so on.
