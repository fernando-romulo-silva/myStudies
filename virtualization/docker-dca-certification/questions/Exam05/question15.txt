D is Correct

Namespaces provide a layer of isolation. 
Docker uses namespaces of various kinds to provide the isolation that containers need in order to remain portable

Limiting the memory is for CGroup:
Cgroups provide resource limitation and reporting capability within the container space.

Common control groups:

* CPU
* Memory
* Network Bandwidth
* Disk
* Priority
