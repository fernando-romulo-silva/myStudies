Which of the following commands can we use to view detailed metadata about a container? 
(select two)

docker metadata
​
B)
docker inspect
​
C)
docker container inspect
​
D)
docker query





































A and C are Correct

Docker includes multiple logging mechanisms to help you get information from running containers and services. 
These mechanisms are called logging drivers. 
Each Docker daemon has a default logging driver, which each container uses unless you configure it to use a different logging driver, or “log-driver” for short.

Because of:

$ docker info --format '{{.LoggingDriver}}'

or

$ docker system info | grep -i log
