What happens if we have a cluster where nodes have myapplication images locally but images have different hashes?

a) If we do not specify the image hash, each node will run tasks with its own image.

b) To ensure all nodes run the same image version, we will need to use --with-registry-auth for remote registries.

c) We will use signed images and Docker Engine on nodes that will use trusted content.

d) It is not possible to ensure that nodes will use the right image version.
























Answer a, b, and c
