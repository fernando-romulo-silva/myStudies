Which of the following is true about Docker Engine access?

a) By default, only owners of a Docker socket are allowed to run containers on a standalone host.

b) We can allow users to run containers allowing their access to either Docker Engine's Unix socket or the API's TCP port (enabled by default).

c) Anyone allowed to log in to the host is also allowed to run containers.

d) Only the root user is allowed to run privileged containers on a host.









































Answer(s) 'a'

Docker engine access ports can be secured with client access certificates (owners) to ensure that only trusted sources are allowed access.
