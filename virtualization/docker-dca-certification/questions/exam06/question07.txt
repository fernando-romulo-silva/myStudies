Which of the following commands will ensure that a container uses a maximum of 1 GB of active memory?

a) ​​docker run --memory-swap 2G nginx
​
b) docker run --memory 1G nginx

c) docker run --memory-swap 2G --memory-reservation 1G
​
d) docker run --memory-reservation 1G nginx








































Answer 'b'

To limit the maximum amount of memory usage for a container, add the --memory option to the docker run command. 
Alternatively, you can use the shortcut -m.

$ docker run -it --memory="1g" ubuntu



If you use  --memory-reservation, it must be set lower than --memory for it to take precedence. 

It's allows you to specify a soft limit smaller than "--memory" which is activated when Docker detects contention or low memory on the host machine. 

Because it is a soft limit, it does not guarantee that the container doesn't exceed the limit.

$ docker container run -d --memory-reservation=250m --name mymem1 alpine:3.8 sleep 3600

$ docker stats  // does not show RAM reservations.

But

If you run top  you will see no virtual RAM allocated. This setting is internal to Docker.
