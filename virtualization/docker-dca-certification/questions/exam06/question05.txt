What is the difference between UCP workers and managers?

a) Ucp-agent service automatically starts serving UCP components and proxy service only on worker node.
​
b) Ucp-agent service automatically starts serving UCP components and proxy service only on manger node.
​
c) Ucp-agent service automatically starts serving all UCP components in manager node and only proxy service in worker node.
​
d) Ucp-agent service automatically starts serving UCP components in worker node, and only a proxy service in manager node.









































Answer 'c'

If the node is a:

Manager: the ucp-agent service automatically starts serving all UCP components, including the UCP web UI and data stores used by UCP. 
The ucp-agent accomplishes this by deploying several containers on the node. 
By promoting a node to manager, UCP automatically becomes highly available and fault tolerant.

Worker: on worker nodes, the ucp-agent service starts serving a proxy service that ensures only authorized users and other UCP services
can run Docker commands in that node. The ucp-agent deploys a subset of containers on worker nodes.
