D)

Answer 'C'

Volumes have several advantages over bind mounts:

* Volumes are easier to back up or migrate than bind mounts.

* You can manage volumes using Docker CLI commands or the Docker API.

* Volumes work on both Linux and Windows containers.

* Volumes can be more safely shared among multiple containers.

* Volume drivers let you store volumes on remote hosts or cloud providers, to encrypt the contents of volumes, or to add other functionality.

* New volumes can have their content pre-populated by a container.

* Volumes on Docker Desktop have much higher performance than bind mounts from Mac and Windows hosts.


In addition, volumes are often a better choice than persisting data in a container’s writable layer, 
because a volume does not increase the size of the containers using it, and the volume’s contents exist outside the lifecycle of a given container.
