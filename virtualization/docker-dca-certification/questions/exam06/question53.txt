B)
FALSE










































Answer 'A'

Docker log driver supports only json-file and journald.

By default, Docker captures the standard output (and standard error) of all your containers, and writes them in files using the JSON format. 
The JSON format annotates each line with its origin (stdout or stderr) and its timestamp. 
Each log file contains information about only one container.

The journald logging driver sends container logs to the systemd journal. 
Log entries can be retrieved using the journalctl command, through use of the journal API, or using the docker logs command.
