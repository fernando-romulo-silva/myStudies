Danny wants to prevent Docker Swarm encryption keys from being stored insecurely on her swarm managers. 
How can he tackle enforcing a lock on the swarm cluster?

a) ​Danny can locate the critical files after the installation and delete them.
​
b) Danny cannot do this because Docker does not offer this functionality.
​
c) The autolock feature must be turned on when the cluster is initialized and cannot be enabled after the fact.
​
d) Danny can use the --autolock=true flag with the docker swarm update command









































Answer 'd'

To enable autolock on an existing swarm, set the autolock flag to true.

$ docker swarm update --autolock=true

To disable autolock, set --autolock to false. 

The mutual TLS key and the encryption key used to read and write Raft logs are stored unencrypted on disk. 

There is a trade-off between the risk of storing the encryption key unencrypted at rest and the convenience 
of restarting a swarm without needing to unlock each manager.
