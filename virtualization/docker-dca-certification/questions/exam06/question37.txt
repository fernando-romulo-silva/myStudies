Which of the following is NOT one of the 3 main Docker Container Network Model components?

a) ​Endpoint
​
b) Routing

c) Network
​
d) Sandbox












































'B'

he Docker Container Network Model provides an open interface for vendors and the community to build network drivers. 
The complementary evolution of Docker and SDN technologies is providing more options and capabilities every day. 

The CNM has three elements—sandbox, endpoint, and network. 

Sandbox: The sandbox perfectly isolates a container from the outside world. 

Endpoint: An endpoint is a controlled gateway from the outside woeld into network's sandbox that shields the container.
The endpoint connects the network snadbox (not the container) to the third element of the model, which is the network.

Network: The newtork is the pathway that transports the datapackets of an instance of communication from endpoint to endpoint, 
or ultimately from container to container.
