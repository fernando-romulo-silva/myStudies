Which of the following best describes the procedure for backing up the Universal Control Plane (UCP) metadata?

a) Create an archive for all of the data under the /etc/docker/ucp directory.
​
b) Create an archive for all of the data under the /var/data/ucp directory.
​
c) Run a container from the ucp image with the backup command.
​
d) Run a container from the ucp image with the uninstall-ucp command.









































Answer 'c'

To create a UCP backup, run the command below on a single UCP manager:

$ docker container run --log-driver none --rm -i \
    --name ucp \
    -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
    docker/ucp \
    backup [command options] > backup.tar 

This command creates a tar archive with the contents of all the volumes used by UCP to persist data and streams it to stdout.
