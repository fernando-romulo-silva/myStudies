Which of the following best describes the procedure for backing up the Universal Control Plane (UCP) metadata?

a) Create an archive for all of the data under the /etc/docker/ucp directory.
​
b) Create an archive for all of the data under the /var/data/ucp directory.
​
c) Run a container from the ucp image with the backup command.
​
d) Run a container from the ucp image with the uninstall-ucp command.









































Answer 'c'

To create a UCP backup, run the docker/ucp:3.0. 10 backup command on a single UCP manager. 


This command creates a tar archive with the contents of all the volumes used by UCP to persist data and streams it to stdout.
