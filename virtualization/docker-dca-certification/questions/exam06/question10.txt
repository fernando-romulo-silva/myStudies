Answers 'c' and 'd'

COPY takes in a src and destination. 
It only lets you copy in a local file or directory from your host (the machine building the Docker image) into the Docker image itself.

ADD lets you do that too, but it also supports 2 other sources. 
First, you can use a URL instead of a local file / directory. 
Secondly, you can extract a tar file from the source directly into the destination.
