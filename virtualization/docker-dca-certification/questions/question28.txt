How can docker build avoid the use of cached image layers?

a) Docker will always use cached information. It is not possible to avoid using image caching.

b) By default, image caching is disabled, therefore we need to apply --use-caching to ensure caching is enabled as it will speed up the building process.

c) To avoid image caching, we can use --no-cache. This way, the build will not use any previously saved layers.

d) All of the preceding sentences are wrong.
