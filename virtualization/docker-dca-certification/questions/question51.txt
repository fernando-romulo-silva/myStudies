How can we ensure an image's content immutability?

a) By using signed images.

b) Defining immutable tags in DTR.

c) By using image scanning.

d) Images cannot be immutable.










































Answer(s) 'a' 

The principle of container immutability regards an image unchangeable once it is built,
and requires creating a new image if changes need to be made. 

Image tags are not immutable, and the author of the images can publish the same tag multiple times.
To image become immutable is necessary sign the image.
