We tried to create a service with five replicas but it is not working. 
We cannot reach the reconciliation phase because we get the following error: 1/1: no suitable node (scheduling constraints not satisfied on 5 nodes). 
What could be wrong?

a) The service's image does not exist.

b) We were using a private image and we did not provide authentication credentials.

c) We used constraints for deploying the service's tasks on specific nodes but none of them have the required labels.

d) None of the preceding options are true.





















Answer 'c'
