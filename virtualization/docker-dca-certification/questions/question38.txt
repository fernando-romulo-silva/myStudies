What are the differences between the COPY and ADD Dockerfile primitives?

a) COPY adds files in read-only mode.

b) COPY can be used to download files from external services.

c) ADD can be used with packaged and compressed files and they will be decompressed in the layer's root filesystem.

d) ADD and COPY are completely equal, but ADD is newer.









































Answer 'c'

COPY takes in a src and destination. 
It only lets you copy in a local file or directory from your host (the machine building the Docker image) into the Docker image itself.

ADD lets you do that too, but it also supports 2 other sources. 
First, you can use a URL instead of a local file / directory. 
Secondly, you can extract a tar file from the source directly into the destination.
