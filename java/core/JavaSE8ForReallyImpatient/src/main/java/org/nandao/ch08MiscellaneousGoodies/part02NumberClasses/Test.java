    // Ever since Java 5, each of the seven numeric primitive type wrappers (i.e., not
    // Boolean) had a static SIZE field that gives the size of the type in bits. You will be
    // glad to know that there is now a BYTES field that reports the size in bytes, for those
    // who cannot divide by eight.
    // All eight primitive type wrappers now have static hashCode methods that return
    // the same hash code as the instance method, but without the need for boxing.
    // The five types Short, Integer, Long, Float, and Double now have static methods sum, max,
    // and min, which can be useful as reduction functions in stream operations. The
    // Boolean class has static methods logicalAnd, logicalOr, and logicalXor for the same purpose.
    // Integer types now support unsigned arithmetic. For example, instead of having
    // a Byte represent the range from â€“128 to 127, you can call the static method
    // Byte.toUnsignedInt(b) and get a value between 0 and 255. In general, with unsigned
    // numbers, you lose the negative values and get twice the range of positive values.
    // The Byte and Short classes have methods toUnsignedInt, and Byte, Short, and Integer
    //have methods toUnsignedLong.
