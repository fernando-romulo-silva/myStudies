// Summary
public class Test {

    // In this chapter, you learned the following:
    //
    //  Executing relatively long-lasting operations using asynchronous tasks can increase the performance
    // and responsiveness of your application, especially if it relies on one or more remote external services.
    //
    //  You should consider providing an asynchronous API to your clients. You can easily implement it using
    // CompletableFutures features.
    //
    //  A CompletableFuture also allows you to propagate and manage errors generated within an asynchronous task.
    //
    //  You can asynchronously consume from a synchronous API by simply wrapping its invocation in a CompletableFuture.
    //
    //  You can compose or combine multiple asynchronous tasks both when they’re independent and when
    // the result of one of them is used as the input to another.
    //
    //  You can register a callback on a CompletableFuture to reactively execute some code when the
    // Future completes and its result becomes available.
    //
    //  You can determine when all values in a list of CompletableFutures have completed, or alternatively
    // you can wait for just the first to complete.
