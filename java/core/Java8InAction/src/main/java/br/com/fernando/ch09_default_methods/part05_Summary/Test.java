    // Summary
    //
    // Following are the key concepts you should take away from this chapter:
    //
    //  Interfaces in Java 8 can have implementation code through default methods and static methods.
    //
    //  Default methods start with a default keyword and contain a body like class methods do.
    //
    //  Adding an abstract method to a published interface is a source incompatibility.
    //
    //  Default methods help library designers evolve APIs in a backward-compatible way.
    //
    //  Default methods can be used for creating optional methods and multiple inheritance of behavior.
    //
    //  There are resolution rules to resolve conflicts when a class inherits from several default methods with the same signature.
    //
    //  A method declaration in the class or a superclass takes priority over any default method declaration.
    // Otherwise, the method with the same signature in the most specific default-providing interface is selected.
    //
    //  When two methods are equally specific, a class can explicitly override a method and select which one to call.
