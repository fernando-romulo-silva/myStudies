    //  Both Java 8 and Scala combine object-oriented and functional programming features into one
    // programming language; both run on the JVM and to a large extent can interoperate.
    //
    //  Scala supports collection abstractions similar to Java 8—List, Set, Map, Stream, Option—but also
    // supports tuples.
    //
    //  Scala provides richer features around functions than Java 8: function types, closures that have no
    // restrictions on accessing local variables, and built-in currying forms.
    //
    //  Classes in Scala can provide implicit constructors, getters, and setters.
    //
    //  Scala supports traits: interfaces that can include both fields and default methods.
