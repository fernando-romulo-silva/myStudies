    //  First-class functions are functions that can be passed as arguments, returned as results, and stored in
    // data structures.
    //
    //  A higher-order function is a function that takes at least one or more functions as input or returns
    // another function. Typical higher-order functions in Java include comparing, andThen, and
    // compose.
    //
    //  Currying is a technique that lets you modularize functions and reuse code.
    //
    //  A persistent data structure preserves the previous version of itself when it’s modified. As a result, it
    // can prevent unnecessary defensive copying.
    //
    //  Streams in Java can’t be self-defined.
    //
    //  A lazy list is a more expressive version of a Java stream. A lazy list lets you produce elements of the list
    // on demand by using a supplier that can create more of the data structure.
    //
    //  Pattern matching is a functional feature that lets you unwrap data types. It can be seen as generalizing
    // Java’s switch statement.
    //
    //  Referential transparency allows computations to be cached.
    //
    //  Combinators are a functional idea that combines two or more functions or other data structures
