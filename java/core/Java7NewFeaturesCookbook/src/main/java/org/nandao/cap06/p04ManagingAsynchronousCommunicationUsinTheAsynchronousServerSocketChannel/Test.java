// Java 7 supports asynchronous communications between a server and a client. The java.
// nio.channels package's AsynchronousServerSocketChannel class supports server
// operations for streaming IO in a thread-safe manner. Communication is conducted using an
// AsynchronousSocketChannel object that acts as a client. Together we can use these
// classes to build a server/client application that communicates in an asynchronous fashion
