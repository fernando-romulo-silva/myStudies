/**
 * Exceptions are a natural part of Batch Processing, and the batch itself should be prepared to deal with
 * exceptions during processing.
 *
 * Batch Processing deals with two kinds of exceptions: skippable and retryable. Skippable Exceptions are used to skip
 * elements during reading, processing and writing and continue to the next element. Retryable Exceptions on the other
 * hand when thrown will try to retry the chunk on which the exception occurred.
 *
 * When the same exception is specified as both retryable and skippable, retryable takes precedence over skippable
 * during regular processing of the chunk. While the chunk is retrying, skippable takes precedence over retryable since
 * the exception is already being retried.
 *
 * The Reader:
 * include::MyItemReader[]
 *
 * Just reads elements from a list and simulate a retry exception.
 *
 * The Processor:
 * include::MyItemProcessor[]
 *
 * Process and simulate a skip exception.
 *
 * The Writer:
 * include::MyItemWriter[]
 *
 * The writer will retry an exception and then skip it.
 *
 * The batch specification also allows you to provide listeners for skipping and retrying for every operation. Have a
 * look into the following classes:
 *
 * * +MySkipReadListener+
 * * +MySkipProcessorListener+
 * * +MySkipWriteListener+
 * * +MyRetryReadListener+
 * * +MyRetryProcessorListener+
 * * +MyRetryWriteListener+
 *
 * Events can be caught via extending the following classes, for the appropriate batch lifecycle event:
 *
 * * +javax.batch.api.chunk.listener.SkipReadListener+
 * * +javax.batch.api.chunk.listener.SkipProcessListener+
 * * +javax.batch.api.chunk.listener.SkipWriteListener+
 * * +javax.batch.api.chunk.listener.RetryReadListener+
 * * +javax.batch.api.chunk.listener.RetryProcessListener+
 * * +javax.batch.api.chunk.listener.RetryWriteListener+
 *
 * include::myJob.xml[]
 *
 * A very simple job is defined in the +myJob.xml+ file. Just a single step with a reader, a processor and a writer. For
 * this sample we are going to process a few records and mix some exceptions during read, processing and write of the
 * chunk. Batch exception handling is achieved by defining the elements +skippable-exception-classes+ and
 * +retryable-exception-classes+ into the +chunk+. Both elements should indicate the full qualified name of the
 * exceptions that we are trying to catch. The +listeners+ element can be used at the +step+ level to define which
 * listeners to run for each batch processing event.
