​
B)

init-method as specified in the Spring XML Configuration
​
D)
Any method named "init"





































Answer 'B'

For each bean in the container the lifecycle happens as follows: 

An instance of the bean is created using the bean metadata. 

Properties and dependencies of the bean are set. 


Any instances of BeanPostProcessor are given a chance to process the new bean instance before and after initialization. 

▪ Any methods in the bean implementation class annotated with @PostConstruct are invoked. 
This processing is performed by a BeanPostProcessor. 

▪ Any afterPropertiesSet method in a bean implementation class implementing the InitializingBean interface is invoked. 
This processing is performed by a BeanPostProcessor. If the same initialization method has already been invoked, it will not be invoked again. 

▪ Any custom bean initialization method is invoked. Bean initialization methods can be specified either in the value of the 
init-method attribute in the corresponding <bean> element in a Spring XML configuration or in the initMethod property of the @Bean annotation. 
This processing is performed by a BeanPostProcessor. If the same initialization method has already been invoked, it will not be invoked again. 

▪ The bean is ready for use.
