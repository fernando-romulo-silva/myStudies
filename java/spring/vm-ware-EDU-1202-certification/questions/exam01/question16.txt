​
C)

​D)
"id" is used as bean identifier








































Answer 'C' and 'D'

Explanation

XML-based configuration metadata, you use the id attribute, the name attribute, or both to specify the bean identifiers. 

The id attribute lets you specify exactly one id. 

Conventionally, these names are alphanumeric ('myBean', 'someService', etc.), but they can contain special characters as well. 

If you want to introduce other aliases for the bean, you can also specify them in the name attribute, separated by a comma (,), semicolon (;), or white space.
