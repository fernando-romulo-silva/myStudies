RANDOM_PORT
​
D)
WEB





































Answer 'A' and 'C'

Explanation

Four different types of web environments can be specified using the webEnvironment attribute of the @SpringBootTest annotation: 

• MOCK - Loads a web ApplicationContext and provides a mock web environment. Does not start a web server. 

• RANDOM_PORT - Loads a WebServerApplicationContext, provides a real web environment and starts an embedded web server listening on a random port. 
The port allocated can be obtained using the @LocalServerPort annotation or @Value("${local.server.port}"). 
Web server runs in a separate thread and server-side transactions will not be rolled back in transactional tests. 

• DEFINED_PORT - Loads a WebServerApplicationContext, provides a real web environment and starts an embedded web server listening on the port 
configured in the application properties, or port 8080 if no such configuration exists. Web server runs in a separate thread and server-side 
transactions will not be rolled back in transactional tests. 

• NONE - Loads an ApplicationContext without providing any web environment.
