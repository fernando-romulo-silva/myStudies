Answer 'A', 'B', 'C' and  'D'

RequestMapping is an annotation for mapping web requests onto methods in request-handling classes with flexible method signatures. 

By default, it will map all HTTP methods. 

One can specify which methods should be allowed using the "method" attribute or use one of the HTTP method variants such as @GetMapping.
