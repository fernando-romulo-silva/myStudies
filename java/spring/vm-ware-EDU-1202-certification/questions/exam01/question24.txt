ObjectMapper

B)​
HATEOAS Security
​
C)
HateoasController

D)​
@EnableHypermediaSupport





































Answer 'A' and  'D'

Spring HATEOAS provides some APIs to ease creating REST representations that follow the HATEOAS principle when working with Spring and especially Spring MVC

If you develop a RESTful API that makes use of hypermedia, Spring Boot provides auto-configuration for Spring HATEOAS that works well with most applications. 

The auto-configuration replaces the need to use @EnableHypermediaSupport and registers a number of beans to ease building hypermedia-based applications, 
including a LinkDiscoverers (for client side support) and an ObjectMapper configured to correctly marshal responses into the desired representation. 

The ObjectMapper is customized by setting the various spring.jackson.* properties or, if one exists, by a Jackson2ObjectMapperBuilder bean. 

You can take control of Spring HATEOAS’s configuration by using @EnableHypermediaSupport. 

Note that doing so disables the ObjectMapper customization described earlier.
