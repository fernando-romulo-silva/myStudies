Which of the following configuration properties must be changed to allow bean definition overriding
​
​A)
management.endpoint.beans.enabled
​
B)
Bean Definition Overriding is allowed by default

C)​
spring.main.allow-bean-definition-overriding

D)​
spring.beaninfo.ignore








































Answer 'C'

Explanation

Spring bean definition overriding is not on by default. 
The first answer refers to BeanInfo configuration, the second to default actuator properties. 

To enable bean overriding, let's set the spring.main.allow-bean-definition-overriding property to true in our application.properties file:

spring.main.allow-bean-definition-overriding=true

By doing this, we are telling Spring Boot to allow bean overriding without any change to bean definitions.
