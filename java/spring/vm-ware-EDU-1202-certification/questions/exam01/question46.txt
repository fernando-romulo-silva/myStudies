Which of the following does Spring Boot provide regarding error handling?

A)
Glboal error page

B)​
Checked exceptions for most common problems
​
C)
Logging errors stack traces separately
​
D)
JSON error response





































Answer 'A' and 'D'

By default, Spring Boot provides an /error mapping that handles all errors in a sensible way, 
and it is registered as a “global” error page in the servlet container. 

For machine clients, it produces a JSON response with details of the error, the HTTP status, and the exception message. 

For browser clients, there is a “whitelabel” error view that renders the same data in HTML format (to customize it, add a View that resolves to error). 

Spring only throws unchecked exceptions in the case of problems.
