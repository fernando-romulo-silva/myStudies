Answer 'A'

Starters are a set of convenient dependency descriptors that you can include in your application. 

You get a one-stop shop for all the Spring and related technologies that you need without having 
to hunt through sample code and copy-paste loads of dependency descriptors. 

For example, if you want to get started using Spring and JPA for database access, 
include the spring-boot-starter-data-jpa dependency in your project.
