Answer 'A'

From version 2.0 onwards Spring Security has improved support substantially for adding security to your service layer methods. 

It provides support for JSR-250 annotation security as well as the framework’s original @Secured annotation. 

From 3.0 you can also make use of new expression-based annotations.

@Service
public class TesseractService {
    
    @PreAuthorize("hasAuthority('ADMIN') or @accessChecker.hasLocalAccess(authentication)")
    public String convert(final MultipartFile data) {
    	...
    }
}
