Answer 'A'

Advice: Action taken by an aspect at a particular join point. 

Different types of advice include “around”, “before” and “after” advice. (Advice types are discussed later.) 

Many AOP frameworks, including Spring, model an advice as an interceptor and maintain a chain of interceptors around the join point.
