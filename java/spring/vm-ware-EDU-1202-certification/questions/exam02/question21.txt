C)​

​
D)
The put and delete methods have a void return type






































Answers 'A' and 'D'

*ForEntity methods return ResponseEntity objects. 
-These contain the response status code as well as the object in the payload. 
-ObjectFactory is not used as an argument in any method of RestTemplate. 

var restTemplate = new RestTemplate();
var fooResourceUrl = "http://localhost:8080/spring-rest/foos";
ResponseEntity<String> response = restTemplate.getForEntity(fooResourceUrl + "/1", String.class);

var statusCode = response.getStatusCode();

*ForObject methods do not return the HTTP status code. 

Foo foo = restTemplate.getForObject(fooResourceUrl + "/1", Foo.class);


put and delete methods return void. 

String entityUrl = fooResourceUrl + "/" + existingResource.getId();
restTemplate.delete(entityUrl);
