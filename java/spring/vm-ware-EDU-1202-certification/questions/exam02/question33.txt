Answers 'B' and 'D'

You can combine pointcut expressions by using &&, || and !. 

You can also refer to pointcut expressions by name. 

  //Special analytics for Update methods
  @Before("allDao() && updateMethod()")
  public void specialAnalytics(JoinPoint joinPoint) {
  
       System.out.println("Call special analytics for: "+ joinPoint.getSignature());
  }
  
  //general analytics for other methods
  @Before("allDao() && !updateMethod()")
  public void generalAnalytics(JoinPoint joinPoint) {
    
       System.out.println("Call general analytics for:"+ joinPoint.getSignature());
  }
