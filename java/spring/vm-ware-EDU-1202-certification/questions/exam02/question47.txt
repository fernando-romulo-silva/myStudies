​
B)
REPEATABLE_READ
​
C)
READ_COMMITED
​
D)
SERIALIZABLE





































Answer 'D'

SERIALIZABLE isolation level is the most restrictive of all isolation levels. 

Transactions are executed with locking at all levels (read, range and write locking) so they appear as if they were executed in a serialized way. 

This leads to a scenario where none of the issues mentioned above may occur, but in the other way we don't allow 
transaction concurrency and consequently introduce a performance penalty.
