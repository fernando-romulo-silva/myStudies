double
​
B)
String
​

Answers 'B' and 'D'

In Spring MVC, controller methods return type needs to be mapped to a view in order to be valid. 
Returned String is a view name, whereas void means that a ServletResponse argument has been modified to contain this view or similar. 
Float and int cannot, however, be mapped to a view.
