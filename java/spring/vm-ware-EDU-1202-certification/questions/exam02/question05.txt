Requires an interface to be declared
​
B)
Requires a third-party library

C)​
Requires the methods to be non-final

D)​
Requires the class to be non-final








































Answer 'B', 'C', and 'D'

Spring AOP can also use CGLIB proxies. This is necessary to proxy classes rather than interfaces. 
Limitations of CGLIB proxies are: 

• Requires the class of the proxied object to be non-final. 
Subclasses cannot be created from final classes. 

• Requires methods in the proxied object to be non-final. 
Final methods cannot be overridden. 

• Does not support self-invocations. 
Self-invocation is where one method of the object invokes another method on the same object. 

• Requires a third-party library. Not built into the Java language and thus require a library. 
The CGLIB library has been included into Spring, so when using the Spring framework, no additional library is required.
