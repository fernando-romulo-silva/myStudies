When using @SpringBootTest(webEnvironment=RANDOM_PORT), how can the port number be injected into a field at runtime?

A)​
@Autowired on an Integer field named "port"

B)​
@SpringPort
​
C)
@LocalServerPort

​D)
@Value("${local.server.port}"





































Answers 'C' and 'D'

@LocalServerPort is a meta-annotation for @Value("${local.server.port}"). 
Do not try to inject the port into a regular application. As we just saw, the value is set only after the container has been initialized. 
Contrary to a test, application code callback
