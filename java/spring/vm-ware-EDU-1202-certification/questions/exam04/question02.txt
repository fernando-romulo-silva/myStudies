  ​

@First
​
B)
@Order
​
C)
@MainBean
​
D)
@Primary







































Answer 'D'

Because autowiring by type may lead to multiple candidates, it is often necessary to have more control over the selection process. 

One way to accomplish this is with Spring’s @Primary annotation. 

@Primary indicates that a particular bean should be given preference when multiple beans are candidates to be autowired to a single-valued dependency. 

If exactly one primary bean exists among the candidates, it becomes the autowired value. 

@Configuration
public class Config {

    @Bean
    public Employee JohnEmployee() {
        return new Employee("John");
    }

    @Bean
    @Primary
    public Employee TonyEmployee() {
        return new Employee("Tony");
    }
}
