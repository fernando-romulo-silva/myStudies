Spring Boot provides a default configuration for the log implementation _______

A)
Commons Logging
​
B)
Log4J2

C)​
SLF4J

D)​
Logback





































Answers 'B' and 'D'

Spring Boot uses Commons Logging for all internal logging but leaves the underlying log implementation open. 

Default configurations are provided for Java Util Logging, Log4J2, and Logback. 

In each case, loggers are pre-configured to use console output with optional file output also available.
