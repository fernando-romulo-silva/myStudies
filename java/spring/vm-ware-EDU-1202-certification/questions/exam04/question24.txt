p1








































Answers 'B' and 'C'

If a given profile is prefixed with the NOT operator (!), the annotated component will be registered if the profile is not active.

For example, given @Profile({"p1", "!p2"}), registration will occur if profile 'p1' is active or if profile 'p2' is not active.
