Which of the following annotations are used on classes which contain methods defining beans?

A)
@Bean

B)​
@Configuration

C)​
@Autowired
​
D)
@Component







































Answers 'B'

Explanation

In Java based configuration, instead of writing bean configurations inside a xml file, 
we choose to write bean definitions inside a class. 

That class is annotated with @Configuration, which means that particular class contains bean definitions in form of methods with @Bean annotation. 

Example: 

@Configuration 
public class AppConfiguration { 
	
	@Bean 
	public Student getStudent() { 
		return new Student(); 
	} 
}
