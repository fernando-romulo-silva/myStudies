Which of the following statements are true about Spring AOP?

A)
When using CGLIB proxies, public and protected method calls can be intercepted

B)​
When using CGLIB proxies, private method calls can be intercepted

C)
When using JDK Proxies, only public interface method calls can be intercepted

D)​
Calls within the same object can be intercepted.







































Answers 'A' and 'C'

Explanation

Calls within the same objects will not be intercepted because Spring AOP is implemented using JDK Proxies. 
When using JDK Proxies, only public method calls are intercepted.

Due to the proxy-based nature of Spring’s AOP framework, calls within the target object are by definition not intercepted. 

For JDK proxies, only public interface method calls on the proxy can be intercepted. 

With CGLIB, public and protected method calls on the proxy will be intercepted, and even package-visible methods if necessary. 

However, common interactions through proxies should always be designed through public signatures.
