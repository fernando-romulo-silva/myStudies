Which of the following are reasons to use a 3rd party external monitoring system?

A)​
Monitoring multiple applications at once

B)​
Visualization of monitoring data

C)​
Monitoring of JVM metrics
​
D)
Exposing endpoints for monitoring over a network








































Answers 'A' and 'B'

Monitoring of JVM metrics is already provided by Spring Boot Actuator. 
Endpoints for monitoring are already exposed over the network using the JMX or HTTP protocol by Spring Boot Actuator. 
Limitations of Spring Boot Actuator include monitoring multiple applications (since each runs its own instance of Actuator). 

Other reasons for using 3rd party external monitoring systems include: 

• Retain monitoring data over time. This gives several subsequent opportunities, some of which are listed below. 
• Allow for querying monitoring data. 
• Allow for visualization of monitoring data. 
• Enable alerting based on monitoring data. 
• Allow for analysis of monitoring data to find trends and to discover anomalies.
