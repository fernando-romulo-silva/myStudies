B)​
Loose coupling

C)​
Interface segregation
​
D)
Reduces number of dependencies







































Answers 'A' and 'B'

Explanation

Dependency Injection does not reduce the number of dependencies, that is the developer's responsibility.

Interface segregation also has no connection.

DI reduces boilerplate code required to inject dependencies and makes classes less loosely coupled (as this boilerplate code is not needed)
