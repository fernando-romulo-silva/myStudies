Which of the following ways of configuring Spring Boot has the highest precedence (overrides the others)?

A)
OS environment variables
​
B)
Profile-specific application properties

C)​
Default Properties
​
D)
@TestPropertySource





































Answers 'A'

@TestPropertySource annotation has the highest precedence out of these answers because test settings override normal application settings. 

@TestPropertySource is a class-level annotation that configures locations of property files and inlined properties in Spring integration test. 
The properties loaded by @TestPropertySource are added to the set of @PropertySource in the Environment for an ApplicationContext.

@ExtendWith(SpringExtension.class)
@ContextConfiguration(classes = AppConfig.class)
@TestPropertySource("/testauth.properties")
public class MyAppTest {
