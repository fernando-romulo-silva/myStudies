Which of the following statements is true regarding the code below?

    @Profile("prod")
    @Configuration
    public class MyConfig{
         @Bean
         public DataSource dataSource(){ ... 
  ​
A)
This code will not have any effect. @ContextConfiguration should be used instead of @Configuration.
​
B)
The Spring Actuator monitoring profile "prod" will be used for data access performance measuring.
​
C)
It is invalid. The @Profile annotation can only be applied to methods.
​
D)
A DataSource bean will be created if the profile is "prod".






































Answers 'A' and 'B'

The sample code is valid. If "prod" is among the current active profiles, 
a bean named "dataSource" will be instantiated by executing the code in the method.
