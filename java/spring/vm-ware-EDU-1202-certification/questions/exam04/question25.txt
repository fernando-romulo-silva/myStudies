In Spring Security, what is the name of the Servlet Filter intercepting all the requests sent to an application?

A)
SecurityFilterChain

B)​
DelegatingProxy
​
C)
DelegatingFilterProxy

D)​
FilterChainProxy








































Answer 'C'

Spring provides a Filter implementation named DelegatingFilterProxy that allows bridging between the Servlet container’s lifecycle and Spring’s ApplicationContext. 

The Servlet container allows registering Filters using its own standards, but it is not aware of Spring defined Beans. 

DelegatingFilterProxy can be registered via standard Servlet container mechanisms, but delegate all the work to a Spring Bean that implements Filter.
