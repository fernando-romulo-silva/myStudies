​
C)
Eager

D)​
Neither








































Answer 'C'

Explanation

By default, ApplicationContext implementations eagerly create and configure all singleton beans as part of the initialization process.
Generally, this pre-instantiation is desirable, because errors in the configuration or surrounding environment are discovered immediately.
When this behavior is not desirable, you can prevent pre-instantiation of a singleton bean by marking the bean definition as being lazy-initialized.

A lazy-initialized bean tells the IoC container to create a bean instance when it is first requested, rather than at startup.
