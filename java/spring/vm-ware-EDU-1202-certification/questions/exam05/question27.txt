_______ is used to map parts of request URL to handler method arguments? 

A)
@ResponseParam

B)
@RequestPart

C)
@PathVariable

D)
@RequestParam












































Answer 'C' 

@PathVariable annotation is used to copy part of URL into local variables of controller methods. 

@RequestPart refers to part of a multipart request, not part of the request URL. 

@RequestParam extracts the annotated parameter from the request parameters (appended after ? at the end of the URL).
