Answers 'B' and 'C'

The @Profile annotation may be used in any of the following ways:

* as a type-level annotation on any class directly or indirectly annotated with @Component, including @Configuration classes

@Component
@Profile("dev")
public class DevDatasourceConfig {

}

@Component
@Profile("!prod")
public class DevDatasourceConfig {

}

* as a method-level annotation on any @Bean method 

@Configuration
class MyConfiguration {

    @Bean
    @Profile("test")
    Service mockService() {
      return new MockService();
    }
}

 

* as a meta-annotation, for the purpose of composing custom stereotype annotations
