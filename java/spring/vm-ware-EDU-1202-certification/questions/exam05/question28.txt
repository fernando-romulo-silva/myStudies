Which of the following transaction propagation behaviour will 
create a new transaction if one does not already exist?

A)
REQUIRED

B)
NESTED

C)
SUPPORTS

D)
MANDATORY











































Answers 'A' and 'B' 

If there is no current transaction, NESTED acts like REQUIRED and creates a new transaction. 

MANDATORY will throw an exception in this case, whereas SUPPORTS will execute the code non-transactionally.
