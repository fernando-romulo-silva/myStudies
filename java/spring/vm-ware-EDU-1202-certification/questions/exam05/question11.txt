In Spring Security, what is the name of the class holding user 
information such as the username and password before Authentication?
  â€‹
A)
GrantedAuthority

B)
AuthenticationManager

C)
AuthenticationProvider

D)
UserDetails







































Answer 'A'

UserDetails is returned by the UserDetailsService. 
The DaoAuthenticationProvider validates the UserDetails and then returns an Authentication that has a principal that 
is the UserDetails returned by the configured UserDetailsService.


private Collection<? extends GrantedAuthority> getAuthorities(Collection<Role> roles) {
 
    List<GrantedAuthority> authorities = new ArrayList<>();
    
    for (Role role: roles) {
        authorities.add(new SimpleGrantedAuthority(role.getName()));
        role.getPrivileges().stream()
            .map(p -> new SimpleGrantedAuthority(p.getName()))
            .forEach(authorities::add);
    }
    
    return authorities;
}
