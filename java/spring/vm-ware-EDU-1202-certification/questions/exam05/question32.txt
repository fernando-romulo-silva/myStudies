Answer 'C' 

HTTP Tracing can be enabled by providing a bean of type HttpTraceRepository in your applicationâ€™s configuration.
For production environments, use of a production-ready tracing or observability solution, such as Zipkin or Spring Cloud Sleuth, is recommended.
Alternatively, create your own HttpTraceRepository that meets your needs. 
The httptrace endpoint can be used to obtain information about the request-response exchanges that are stored in the HttpTraceRepository.
