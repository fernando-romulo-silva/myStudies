Answer 'A'

Alternatively, if you use the @SpringBootTest annotation with WebEnvironment.RANDOM_PORT or WebEnvironment.DEFINED_PORT, 
you can inject a fully configured TestRestTemplate and start using it. 

If necessary, additional customizations can be applied through the RestTemplateBuilder bean.

Any URLs that do not specify a host and port automatically connect to the embedded server.
