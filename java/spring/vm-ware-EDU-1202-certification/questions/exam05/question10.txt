Which of the following annotations can be used to change the order in which the IoC Container instantiates beans?
  ​
A)
@Lazy
​
B)
@Order
​
C)
@DependsOn
​
D)
@Import






































Answers 'A', 'B', 'C' and 'D'

All of these annotations affect the order in which the IoC Container instantiates beans. 

@Lazy makes the Container only instantiate the annotated bean when it is called.
 
@Order directly specifies the order in which beans are instantiated.  

@Import and @DependsOn both make sure that the annotated beans are instantiated after their dependencies.
