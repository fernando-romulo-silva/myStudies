Which of the following affect what Spring Boot auto-configures?

A)
System performance

B)
Other running Spring Applications

C)
Dependencies in Classpath

D)
Declared Beans











































Answers 'C' and 'D' 

Spring Boot auto-configuration attempts to automatically configure your Spring application based on the jar dependencies that you have added. 

For example, if HSQLDB is on your classpath, and you have not manually configured any database connection beans, then Spring Boot auto-configures an in-memory database.

Some explicitly declared beans will be used based on their name (e.g. a bean named "transactionManager" will be used as the application's transaction manager).
