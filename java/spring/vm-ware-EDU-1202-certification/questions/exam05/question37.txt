All exceptions classes in Spring ____.

A)
are checked

B)
are unchecked

C)
are either checked or unchecked

D)
inherit SpringException











































Answer 'B' 

Spring prefer Unchecked Exceptions as it gives developers freedom of choice as to decide 
where to implement error handling and removes coupling related to exceptions. 

It also removes cluttered code as there is no requirement of try-catch blocks.
