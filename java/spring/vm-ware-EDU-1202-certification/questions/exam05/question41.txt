Answer 'A' 

DataAccessException is the root data access exception class in Spring Framework. 

The Data Access Object (DAO) support in Spring allows us to isolate minimal amount of code related to particular database technology easily. 

The most important DAO support is DataAccessException hierarchy which let the client code handle the exceptions without knowing the details 
of the particular data access API in use (e.g. JDBC, JPA, Hibernate etc). 

That means it is possible to handle an exception like JdbcSQLException in a generic way without knowing that JDBC is being used in the DAO layer.
