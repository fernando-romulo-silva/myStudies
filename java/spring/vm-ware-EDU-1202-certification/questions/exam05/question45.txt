Classes annotated with ________ will be detected by component scanning.

A)
@Bean

B)
@Component

C)
@Configuration

D)
@Scanned











































Answers 'B' and 'C' 

Component scan picks up classes annotated with @Component or stereotype annotations (which are simply meta annotated with @Component) like @Configuration. 

@Bean is applied at method level. 

The annotation @Scanned does not exist in Spring.
