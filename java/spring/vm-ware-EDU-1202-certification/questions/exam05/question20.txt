Answer 'D'

Annotation that can be specified on a test class that runs Spring Boot based tests. 

Provides the following features over and above the regular Spring TestContext Framework: Uses SpringBootContextLoader as the default ContextLoader when no specific @ContextConfiguration(loader=...) is defined.

Automatically searches for a @SpringBootConfiguration when nested @Configuration is not used, and no explicit classes are specified. 

Allows custom Environment properties to be defined using the properties attribute.

Allows application arguments to be defined using the args attribute.

Provides support for different webEnvironment modes, including the ability to start a fully running web server listening on a defined or random port. 

Registers a TestRestTemplate and/or WebTestClient bean for use in web tests that are using a fully running web server.
