Which of the following types of AOP advice can be used to prevent execution of the advised method?
  â€‹
A)
@Before

B)
@After

C)
@Around
    
D)    
@AfterThrowing













































Answers 'B', 'C' and 'D' 

If the Before advice throws an exception, the join point will not be called. 

By not calling the 'proceed()' on the ProceedingJoinPoint parameter of the Around advice method, the join point (target method) will not be executed. 

'After returning advice' and 'After throwing advice' are involved only after the execution of the join point.
