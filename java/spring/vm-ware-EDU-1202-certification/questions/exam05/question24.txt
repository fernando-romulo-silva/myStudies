Which of the following paths will be matched by mvcMatchers(/*/employees")?
  â€‹
A)
/hr/archived/employees

B)
/management/employees

C)
/hr/employees.html

D)
/hr/employees











































Answers 'B', 'C' and 'D' 

The last one is not matched because there are 2 URL parts ("hr" and "archived") before employees, but only 1 is permitted in the pattern. 

Since mvcMatchers was used, paths that would match but have a file extension (such as .html or .css), will also be matched (unlike antMatchers).
