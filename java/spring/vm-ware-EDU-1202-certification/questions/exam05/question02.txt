Answer 'B'

Using the @Value("${property}") annotation to inject configuration properties can sometimes be cumbersome, 
especially if you are working with multiple properties or your data is hierarchical in nature. 

Spring Boot provides an alternative method of working with properties that lets strongly typed beans
govern and validate the configuration of your application. 

It is possible to bind a bean declaring standard JavaBean properties as shown.
