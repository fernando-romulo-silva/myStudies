When does the JdbcTemplate class acquire a database connection?

C)

D)
During JdbcTemplate instantiation











































Answer 'C' 

JdbcTemplate acquires a database connection only during a method call, 
which requires data access, and releases it as soon as the rows are fetched. 

This is so that resources are not held longer than necessary.
