Which of the following methods will be called last in the bean lifecycle?
  ​
A)
Any method named "destroy"
​
B)
Any methods annotated with @PreDestroy

C)​
destroy-method as specified in the Spring XML Configuration

D)
destroy method in the DisposableBean interface
   








































Answer 'C'

When the Spring application context is to shut down, 
the beans in it will receive destruction callbacks in this order: 

▪ Any methods in the bean implementation class annotated with @PreDestroy are invoked. 

▪ Any destroy method in a bean implementation class implementing the DisposableBean interface is invoked. 
If the same destruction method has already been invoked, it will not be invoked again. 

▪ Any custom bean destruction method is invoked. 
Bean destruction methods can be specified either in the value of the destroy-method attribute 
in the corresponding <bean> element in a Spring XML configuration or in the destroyMethod property of the @Bean annotation. 
If the same destruction method has already been invoked, it will not be invoked again.

@PreDestroy -> DisposableBean -> destroy-method
