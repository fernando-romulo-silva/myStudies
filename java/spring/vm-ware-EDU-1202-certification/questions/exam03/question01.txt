C)​
FrontController
​
D)
Controller
   








































Answer 'A'

Spring MVC, like many other web frameworks, is designed around the front controller pattern where a central Servlet, the DispatcherServlet, 
provides a shared algorithm for request processing while actual work is performed by configurable, delegate components. 

This model is flexible and supports diverse workflows. Controller is an annotation placed on controller classes. 
The other 2 classes do not exist.
