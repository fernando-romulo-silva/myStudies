regardless if it completes normally or throws an exception?
  ​
A)
@AfterThrowing
​
B)
@Around
​
C)
@After

D)​
@AfterReturning








































Answer 'C'

After (finally) advice will execute regardless if an exception was thrown or not.

An After advice runs after the target method is finished, including when the target method results in exception. 
This advice is similar to the finally block in Java that it always executes irrespective of the outcome. 

	@After("execution(* com.amitph.spring.aop.service.FileSystemStorageService.readFile(..)) ")
    public void logAfterMethodCall() {
        log.info("After Executing target");
    }
