Answers 'A'

In Spring, the objects that form the backbone of your application and that are managed by the Spring IoC container are called beans.
A bean is an object that is instantiated, assembled, and managed by a Spring IoC container. 
Otherwise, a bean is simply one of many objects in your application. 
Beans, and the dependencies among them, are reflected in the configuration metadata used by a container.
