@Qualifier








































Answers  'A', 'B', 'C' and 'D'

@Primary is an effective way to use autowiring by type with several instances when one primary candidate can be determined. 
When you need more control over the selection process, you can use Spring’s @Qualifier annotation. 

You can associate qualifier on a field or parameter as a qualifier for candidate beans when autowiring. 
It may also be used to annotate other custom annotations that can then in turn be used as qualifiers.

@Named works the same as @Component. 
However, the annotations @Controller, @Service, and @Repository are more specific.

@Named
public class BlaBean {

}

@Configuration
public class AppConfig {
	
	@Inject
	private BlaBean blabean;

	@Autowired
	@Qualifier("myBean")
	public void setMyBean(String myBean){
	    this.myBean=myBean;
	}
	
	@Bean
    @Primary
    public ObjectMapper objectMapper() {
    	...
    }
    
    @Bean(name = "objectMapperB")
    public ObjectMapper orderServiceByProvider2() {
        ....
    }
}
