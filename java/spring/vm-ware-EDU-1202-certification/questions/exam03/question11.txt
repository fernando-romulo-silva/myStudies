Which of the following affect which packages get component scanned?
  ​
A)
<context:component-scan> in XML Configuration

B)​
location field of ComponentScanner bean
​
C)
Configuration property spring.scan.location
​
D)
scanBasePackages attribute of @SpringBootApplication class
   








































Answers 'A' and 'D'

@ComponentScan.basePackages specifies the packages to be scanned as a String. 
basePackageClasses is the type-safe alternative to this (scans the package that each class is in). 
SpringBootApplication provides alias fields for both of these methods. 

Basically, <context:component-scan> detects the annotations by package scanning. 
To put it differently, it tells Spring which packages need to be scanned to look for the annotated beans or components.

<context:component-scan base-package="com.baeldung.annotationconfigvscomponentscan.components" />
