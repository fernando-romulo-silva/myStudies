  ​

@JpaTest
​
B)
@Test
​
C)
@DataJpaTest
​
D)
@DataTest








































Answer 'C'

@DataJpaTest is an annotation that can be used in combination with @RunWith(SpringRunner.class) for a typical JPA test. 

Can be used when a test focuses only on JPA components. 

The annotation disables full auto-configuration and applies only configuration relevant to JPA tests. 

By default, tests annotated with @DataJpaTest use an embedded in-memory database.

@RunWith(SpringRunner.class)
@DataJpaTest
public class CityRepositoryTest {

    @Autowired
    private CityRepository repository;

    @Test
    public void should_find_all_customers() {

        Iterable<City> cities = repository.findAll();

        int nOfCities = 12;
        assertThat(cities).hasSize(nOfCities);
    }
}
