    // JavaServer Faces is a server-side user interface (UI) framework for Java-based web applications. JSF allows you to:
    // * Create a web page with a set of reusable UI components following the Model-ViewController (MVC) design pattern.
    // * Bind components to a server-side model. This allows a two-way migration of application data with the UI.
    // * Handle page navigation in response to UI events and model interactions.
    // * Manage UI component state across server requests.
    // * Provide a simple model for wiring client-generated events to server-side application code.
    // * Easily build and reuse custom UI components.
    //
    // A JSF application consists of:
    //
    // * A set of web pages in which the UI components are laid out.
    // * A set of managed beans. One set of beans binds components to a server-side model (typically CDI beans) and another set acts as controller (typically EJB or CDI beans).
    // * An optional deployment descriptor, web.xml.
    // * An optional configuration file, faces-config.xml.
    // * An optional set of custom objects such as converters and listeners, created by the application developer.
