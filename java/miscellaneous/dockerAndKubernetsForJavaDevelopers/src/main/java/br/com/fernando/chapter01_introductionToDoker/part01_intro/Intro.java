    // A container is not a virtual machine in the popular sense.
    // It behaves as a kind of operating system virtualization, but there's no emulation at all.
    // The main difference is that while each traditional virtual machine image runs on an independent guest operating system, the Docker containers run within the same kernel running on the host machine.
    // A container is self-sufficient and isolated not only from the underlying OS, but from other containers as well.
    // It has its own separated filesystem and environment variables.
    // Naturally, containers can communicate with each other (as an application and a database container for example) and also can share the files on disk. ]
    // Here comes the main difference when comparing to traditional virtualization because the containers run within the same kernel they utilize fewer system resources.
