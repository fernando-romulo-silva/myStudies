	// A namespace functions as a grouping mechanism inside of Kubernetes. 
	// Pods, volumes, ReplicaSets, and services can easily cooperate within a namespace, but the namespace provides an isolation from the other parts of the cluster.
	//
	// Well, namespaces let you manage different environments within the same cluster. 
	// For example, you can have different test and staging environments in the same cluster of machines.
