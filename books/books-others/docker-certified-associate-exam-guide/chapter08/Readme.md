# Chapter 8

## Previous requirements
In this chapter we will learn Docker Swarm orchestrator features. We provide some labs at the end of the chapter that will help you understand and learn shown concepts. These labs can be run on your laptop or PC using the provided vagrant Docker Swarm environment or any already deployed Docker Swarm cluster at your own. Check additional information in this book's github code repository available in this link https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Docker-Certified-Associate-DCA-Exam-Guide.git.

You will need at least (all labs were tested on Linux and Windows):

    - Interne connection.
    - Some Linux, MacOS or Windows basic skills to edit files (using Notepad, Vim, Emacs or any other editor).
    - Git command-line, Vagrant and Virtualbox installed on your PC or laptop.
    - Already cloned book' s repository https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Docker-Certified-Associate-DCA-Exam-Guide.git.
    - Enough hardware resources: 4vCPU, 8GB of RAM and 75 GB of available disk space on your hard drive for virtual nodes.

Extended instructions can be found on Github book's repository. These labs will use "environments/swarm" folder for the creation of the virtual environment and "chapter8" folder.
>NOTE: To clone book' s repository https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Docker-Certified-Associate-DCA-Exam-Guide.git, prepare a directory on your laptop or PC and execute git clone https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Docker-Certified-Associate-DCA-Exam-Guide.git. This will download all required files on your current folder.

All labs will start executing vagrant up  using your command-line from the environment directory "environments/swarm". This command will start all the required nodes for you. If you are using your own Docker Swarm cluster, you can use "chapter8" folder. Ask your Docker administrator for the cluster-required credentials for your environment to execute the provided labs.

Once all environment nodes are up and running, go to "chapter8" folder and follow each lab instructions.

After completed the labs, you can use vagrant destroy -f from "environments/swarm" directory to completely remove all the lab-deployed nodes and free your disk.

### Following labs can be found under chapter8 directory.

## __Lab1__: Creating a Swarm Cluster

In this lab we will create a Docker Swarm cluster from the very begining.

1 - Connect to swarm-node1 and initialize a new cluster using _docker swarm init_: 
```
$ vagrant ssh swarm-node1
vagrant@swarm-node1:~$ docker swarm init
Error response from daemon: could not choose an IP address to advertise
since this system has multiple addresses on different interfaces (10.0.2.15
on eth0 and 10.10.10.11 on eth1) - specify one with --advertise-addr
```
We get an error and this is completely normal because you are using Vagrant and nodes at least will have 2 interfaces. First one is internal for Vagrant, and we will have others, defined to be used on lab environments. In this case we will need to specify which interface to use for the cluster with _--advertise-addr_.

Let's try again using _--advertise-addr 10.10.10.11_:
```
vagrant@swarm-node1:~$ docker swarm init --advertise-addr 10.10.10.11
Swarm initialized: current node (b1t5o5x8mqbz77e9v4ihd7cec) is now a manager.
To add a worker to this swarm, run the following command:
docker swarm join --token SWMTKN-1-3xfi4qggreh81lbr98d63x7299gtz1fanwfjkselg9ok5wroje-didcmb39w7apwokrah6xx4cus 10.10.10.11:2377

To add a manager to this swarm, run 'docker swarm join-token manager' and follow the instructions.
```

Now Swarm was initialized correctly.

2 - Add a second node connecting to swarm-node2 and executing described command in initialization output.
```
$ vagrant ssh swarm-node2
vagrant@swarm-node2:~$ docker swarm join --token SWMTKN-1-3xfi4qggreh81lbr98d63x7299gtz1fanwfjkselg9ok5wroje-didcmb39w7apwokrah6xx4cus 10.10.10.11:2377
This node joined a swarm as a worker.
```

Node was added as worker.

3 - Verify on swarm-node1 that new node was added.
```
$ vagrant ssh swarm-node1
vagrant@swarm-node1:~$ docker node ls
ID                        HOSTNAME STATUS AVAILABILITY MANAGER STATUS ENGINE VERSION
b1t5o5x8mqbz77e9v4ihd7cec * swarm-node1  Ready  Active          Leader          19.03.5
rj3rgb9egnb256cms0zt8pqew   swarm-node2  Ready  Active                          19.03.5
```

4 - We will execute same joining process on swarm-node3.
```
vagrant@swarm-node1:~$ docker node ls
ID                          HOSTNAME STATUS AVAILABILITY MANAGER STATUS ENGINE VERSION
b1t5o5x8mqbz77e9v4ihd7cec * swarm-node1     Ready Active        Leader          19.03.5
rj3rgb9egnb256cms0zt8pqew   swarm-node2     Ready Active                        19.03.5
ui67xyztnw8kn6fjjezjdtwxd   swarm-node3     Ready Active                        19.03.5
```

5 - Now we will review the token for managers so next node will be added as manager.
```
vagrant@swarm-node1:~$ docker swarm join-token manager
To add a manager to this swarm, run the following command:
docker swarm join --token SWMTKN-1-3xfi4qggreh81lbr98d63x7299gtz1fanwfjkselg9ok5wroje-aidvtmglkdyvvqurnivcsmyzm 10.10.10.11:2377
```

Now, we connect to swarm-node4 and execute shown joinning command.
```
vagrant@swarm-node4:~$ docker swarm join --token SWMTKN-1-3xfi4qggreh81lbr98d63x7299gtz1fanwfjkselg9ok5wroje-aidvtmglkdyvvqurnivcsmyzm 10.10.10.11:2377
This node joined a swarm as a manager
```

6 - Cluster now have 4 nodes, 2 managers and 2 workers. This will not provide high availability if Leader fails. LetÅ› promote swarm-node2 to manager too for example.
```
vagrant@swarm-node4:~$ docker node update --role manager swarm-node2
swarm-node2
```

And we can review node status again. Managers are show as "Reachable" or "Leader", indicating that this node is the cluster leader.
```
vagrant@swarm-node4:~$ docker node ls
ID                        HOSTNAME STATUS AVAILABILITY MANAGER STATUS ENGINE VERSION
b1t5o5x8mqbz77e9v4ihd7cec   swarm-node1     Ready Active            Leader      19.03.5
rj3rgb9egnb256cms0zt8pqew   swarm-node2     Ready Active            Reachable   19.03.5
ui67xyztnw8kn6fjjezjdtwxd   swarm-node3     Ready Active                        19.03.5
jw9uvjcsyg05u1slm4wu0hz6l * swarm-node4     Ready Active            Reachable   19.03.5
```

7 - We will just leave one manager for the rest of the Labs, but first we will kill swarm-node1 Docker Engine Daemon to see what happens in the cluster.
```
$ vagrant ssh swarm-node1
vagrant@swarm-node1:~$ sudo systemctl stop docker
```

Connecting to other manager (swarm-node2 for example, recently promoted node).
```
$ vagrant ssh swarm-node2
vagrant@swarm-node2:~$ docker node ls
ID HOSTNAME STATUS AVAILABILITY MANAGER STATUS ENGINE   VERSION
b1t5o5x8mqbz77e9v4ihd7cec   swarm-node1 Down Active Unreachable 19.03.5
rj3rgb9egnb256cms0zt8pqew * swarm-node2 Ready Active Reachable 19.03.5
ui67xyztnw8kn6fjjezjdtwxd   swarm-node3 Ready Active           19.03.5
jw9uvjcsyg05u1slm4wu0hz6l   swarm-node4 Ready Active  Leader   19.03.5
```

New leader was elected between one of the managers.
We now start again swarm-node1 Docker Engine Daemon.
```
$ vagrant ssh swarm-node1
vagrant@swarm-node1:~$ sudo systemctl start docker
vagrant@swarm-node1:~$ docker node ls
ID HOSTNAME STATUS AVAILABILITY MANAGER STATUS ENGINE   VERSION
b1t5o5x8mqbz77e9v4ihd7cec * swarm-node1 Ready Active Reachable 19.03.5
rj3rgb9egnb256cms0zt8pqew   swarm-node2 Ready Active Reachable 19.03.5
ui67xyztnw8kn6fjjezjdtwxd   swarm-node3 Ready Active           19.03.5
jw9uvjcsyg05u1slm4wu0hz6l   swarm-node4 Ready Active  Leader   19.03.5
```

Node remains as manager but it is not now the leader of the cluster because a new one was elected when it failed.

8 - Let's demote all non-leader nodes to workers for the rest of the labs.
```
vagrant@swarm-node1:~$ docker node update --role worker swarm-node2
swarm-node2

vagrant@swarm-node1:~$ docker node update --role worker swarm-node1
swarm-node1

vagrant@swarm-node1:~$ docker node ls
Error response from daemon: This node is not a swarm manager. Worker nodes can't be used to view or modify cluster state. Please run this command on a manager node or promote the current node to a manager.
```

Notice the error when listing again. swarm-node1 is not manager now hence we can not manage the cluster from this node anymore. All management commands will run now from swarm-node4 for the rest of the labs. swarm-node4 is the only manager hence it is the cluster leader.
```
$ vagrant ssh swarm-node4
vagrant@swarm-node4:~$ docker node ls
ID HOSTNAME STATUS AVAILABILITY MANAGER STATUS ENGINE   VERSION
b1t5o5x8mqbz77e9v4ihd7cec   swarm-node1 Ready Active          19.03.5
rj3rgb9egnb256cms0zt8pqew   swarm-node2 Ready Active          19.03.5
ui67xyztnw8kn6fjjezjdtwxd   swarm-node3 Ready Active          19.03.5
jw9uvjcsyg05u1slm4wu0hz6l * swarm-node4 Ready Active  Leader  19.03.5
```

## __Lab2__: Deploy a Simple Replicated Service

In this lab we will deploy a simple replicated service. From swarm-node4, we will create a replicated service (by default) and test how we can distributemore replicas on different nodes.

1 - Deploy _webserver_ service using a simple _nginx:alpine_ image.
```
vagrant@swarm-node4:~$ docker service create --name webserver nginx:alpine
kh906v3xg1ni98xk466kk48p4
overall progress: 1 out of 1 tasks
1/1: running [==================================================>]
verify: Service converged
Notice that we waited few seconds until all instances are correctly running. Time may vary if image has some configured healthcheck.
```

2 - Once it is deployed we can review where replica was started.
```
vagrant@swarm-node4:~$ docker service ps webserver
ID           NAME         IMAGE        NODE   DESIRED STATE CURRENT STATE ERROR PORTS
wb4knzpud1z5 webserver.1  nginx:alpine swarm-node3    Running     Running 14 seconds ago
```

In this case nginx was deployed on _swarm-node4_. This may vary in your environment.

3 - We can scale the number of replicas to 3 and review how they were distributed.
```
$ docker service update --replicas 3 webserver
webserver
overall progress: 3 out of 3 tasks
1/3: running [==================================================>]
2/3: running [==================================================>]
3/3: running [==================================================>]
verify: Service converged
```

If we review replicas distribution we will discover where containers are running.
```
vagrant@swarm-node4:~$ docker service ps webserver
ID            NAME        IMAGE       NODE  DESIRED STATE CURRENT STATE ERROR PORTS
wb4knzpud1z5 webserver.1 nginx:alpine swarm-node3 Running Running 2 minutes ago
ie9br2pblxu6 webserver.2 nginx:alpine swarm-node4 Running Running 50 seconds ago
9d021pmvnnrq webserver.3 nginx:alpine swarm-node1 Running Running 50 seconds ago
```

We notice in this case that swarm-node2 did not receive any replica. But we can force replicas to run there.


4 - To force specific locations we can add labels to specific nodes and add constraints to nodes.
```
$ docker node update --label-add tier=front swarm-node2
swarm-node2
```

And now we modify the current service.
```
vagrant@swarm-node4:~$ docker service update --constraint-add node.labels.tier==front webserver
webserver
overall progress: 3 out of 3 tasks
1/3: running  [==================================================>]
2/3: running  [==================================================>]
3/3: running  [==================================================>]
verify: Service converged


vagrant@swarm-node4:~$ docker service ps webserver
ID            NAME             IMAGE         NODE   DESIRED STATE   CURRENT STATE ERROR     PORTS
wjgkgkn0ullj  webserver.1      nginx:alpine  swarm-node2    Running         Running 24 seconds ago
wb4knzpud1z5
               \_ webserver.1  nginx:alpine  swarm-node3    Shutdown        Shutdown 25 seconds ago
bz2b4dw1emvw   webserver.2     nginx:alpine  swarm-node2    Running         Running 26 seconds ago
ie9br2pblxu6   \_ webserver.2  nginx:alpine  swarm-node4    Shutdown        Shutdown 27 seconds ago
gwzvykixd5oy   webserver.3     nginx:alpine  swarm-node2    Running         Running 28 seconds ago
9d021pmvnnrq   \_ webserver.3  nginx:alpine  swarm-node1    Shutdown        Shutdown 29 seconds ago
```

Now all replicas are running on swarm-node2.


5 - Now we will do some maintenance on swarm-node2. In this situation we will remove service constraint before draining swarm-node2. If we do not do that, no other node will receive workloads because they are restricted to tier=front node labels.
```
vagrant@swarm-node4:~$ docker service update --constraint-rm
node.labels.tier==front webserver
webserver
overall progress: 3 out of 3 tasks
1/3: running  [==================================================>]
2/3: running  [==================================================>]
3/3: running  [==================================================>]
verify: Service converged
```

Execute _docker service ps webserver_ to review workloads distribution.
```
vagrant@swarm-node4:~$ docker service ps webserver
```

Tasks did not move because tasks already satisfy service constraints (no constraint in the new situation).

6 - On this step we will pause swarm-node3 and drain swarm-node2.
```
vagrant@swarm-node4:~$ docker node update --availability pause swarm-node3
swarm-node3

vagrant@swarm-node4:~$ docker node update --availability drain swarm-node2
swarm-node2
```

Now, let's review service replica distribution
```
vagrant@swarm-node4:~$ docker service ps webserver --filter desired-state=running
ID              NAME        IMAGE         NODE  DESIRED STATE  CURRENT STATE ERROR PORTS
6z55nch0q8ai    webserver.1 nginx:alpine  swarm-node4 Running        Running 3 minutes ago
8il59udc4iey    webserver.2 nginx:alpine  swarm-node4 Running        Running 3 minutes ago
1y4q96hb3hik    webserver.3 nginx:alpine  swarm-node1 Running        Running 3 minutes ago
```

Notice that only swarm-node1 and swarm-node4 get some tasks because swarm-node3 is paused and we removed
all tasks on swarm-node2.


7 - We will remove webserver service and enable nodes swarm-node2 and swarm-node3 again.
```
vagrant@swarm-node4:~$ docker service rm webserver
webserver

vagrant@swarm-node4:~$ docker node update --availability active swarm-node2
swarm-node2

vagrant@swarm-node4:~$ docker node update --availability active swarm-node3
swarm-node3
```

## __Lab3__: Deploy a Global Service

In this lab we will deploy a global service.

1 - We learned that global services will deploy one replica on each node. Let's create one and review its distribution.
```
vagrant@swarm-node4:~$ docker service create --name webserver --mode global nginx:alpine
4xww1in0ozy3g8q6yb6rlbidr
overall progress: 4 out of 4 tasks
ui67xyztnw8k: running [==================================================>]
b1t5o5x8mqbz: running [==================================================>]
rj3rgb9egnb2: running [==================================================>]
jw9uvjcsyg05: running [==================================================>]
verify: Service converged
```

All nodes will receive their own replica.
```
vagrant@swarm-node4:~$ docker service ps webserver --filter desired-state=running

ID           NAME                                 IMAGE     NODE  DESIRED STATE      CURRENT STATE  ERROR PORTS
0jb3tolmta6u webserver.ui67xyztnw8kn6fjjezjdtwxd nginx:alpine swarm-node3 Running  Running about a minute ago
im69ybzgd879 webserver.rj3rgb9egnb256cms0zt8pqew nginx:alpine swarm-node2 Running  Running about a minute ago
knh5ntkx7b3r webserver.jw9uvjcsyg05u1slm4wu0hz6l nginx:alpine swarm-node4 Running  Running about a minute ago
26kzify7m7xd webserver.b1t5o5x8mqbz77e9v4ihd7cec nginx:alpine swarm-node1 Running  Running about a minute ago
```

2 - We will now drain swarm-node1 for example and review the new tasks distribution.
```
vagrant@swarm-node4:~$ docker node update --availability drain swarm-node1
swarm-node1

vagrant@swarm-node4:~$ docker service ps webserver --filter desired-state=running

ID           NAME                                 IMAGE      NODE  DESIRED STATE    CURRENT STATE   ERROR  PORTS
0jb3tolmta6u webserver.ui67xyztnw8kn6fjjezjdtwxd nginx:alpine swarm-node3 Running Running 3 minutes ago
im69ybzgd879 webserver.rj3rgb9egnb256cms0zt8pqew nginx:alpine swarm-node2 Running Running 3 minutes ago
knh5ntkx7b3r webserver.jw9uvjcsyg05u1slm4wu0hz6l nginx:alpine swarm-node4 Running Running 3 minutes ago
```

None received swarm-node2 task. Because global services will only run one replica of defined service.

3 - If we enable again swarm-node2, its replica will start to run again.
```
vagrant@swarm-node4:~$ docker node update --availability active swarm-node1
swarm-node1

vagrant@swarm-node4:~$ docker service ps webserver --filter desired-state=running
ID            NAME                                 IMAGE      NODE   DESIRED STATE   CURRENT STATE  ERROR PORTS
sun8lxwu6p3k webserver.b1t5o5x8mqbz77e9v4ihd7cec nginx:alpine swarm-node1 Running Running 1 second ago
0jb3tolmta6u webserver.ui67xyztnw8kn6fjjezjdtwxd nginx:alpine swarm-node3 Running Running 5 minutes
im69ybzgd879 webserver.rj3rgb9egnb256cms0zt8pqew nginx:alpine swarm-node2 Running Running 5 minutes
knh5ntkx7b3r webserver.jw9uvjcsyg05u1slm4wu0hz6l nginx:alpine swarm-node4 Running Running 5 minutes

```

4 - We will remove webserver service again to clear cluster for the next labs.
```
vagrant@swarm-node4:~$ docker service rm webserver
webserver
```

## __Lab4__: Update Service Base Image

We will now take a quick look to service update to learn how to update service base image for example.
We will quick and easy refresh a new image version of deployed and running servicewithout user access interruption.

1-First we created a 6 replicas webserver service.
```
vagrant@swarm-node4:~$ docker service create --name webserver \
--replicas 6 --update-delay 10s --update-order start-first \
nginx:alpine
vpllw7cxlma7mwojdyswbkmbk

overall progress: 6 out of 6 tasks
1/6: running [==================================================>]
2/6: running [==================================================>]
3/6: running [==================================================>]
4/6: running [==================================================>]
5/6: running [==================================================>]
6/6: running [==================================================>]
verify: Service converged
```

2 - We update now to an specific nginx:alpine version with perl support for example.
```
vagrant@swarm-node4:~$ docker service update --image nginx:alpine-perl webserver
webserver

overall progress: 6 out of 6 tasks
1/6: running [==================================================>]
2/6: running [==================================================>]
3/6: running [==================================================>]
4/6: running [==================================================>]
5/6: running [==================================================>]
6/6: running [==================================================>]
verify: Service converged
```

Update took more than 60 seconds because Swarm updated tasks one by one in 10 seconds intervals. It will first start the new container with the new defined image. Once it is healthy, it will stop old version container. This must be done on each task therefore takes more time but we can ensure that there were always a webserver task running. In this example we have not publish webserver ports so no user interaction was expected.

New version is running now
```
vagrant@swarm-node4:~$ docker service ps webserver --filter desired-state=running
ID              NAME          IMAGE               NODE   DESIRED STATE    CURRENT STATE     ERROR     PORTS
n9s6lrk8zp32    webserver.1   nginx:alpine-perl   swarm-node4  Running  Running 4 minutes ago
68istkhse4ei    webserver.2   nginx:alpine-perl   swarm-node1  Running  Running 5 minutes ago
j6pqig7njhdw    webserver.3   nginx:alpine-perl   swarm-node1  Running  Running 6 minutes ago
k4vlmeb56kys    webserver.4   nginx:alpine-perl   swarm-node2  Running  Running 5 minutes ago
k50fxl1gms44    webserver.5   nginx:alpine-perl   swarm-node3  Running  Running 5 minutes ago
apur3w3nq95m    webserver.6   nginx:alpine-perl   swarm-node3  Running  Running 5 minutes ago
```

3 - We will remove webserver service again to clear cluster for the next labs.
```
vagrant@swarm-node4:~$ docker service rm webserver
webserver
```

## __Lab5__: Deploying using Docker Stacks

In this lab we will deploy a PostgreSQL database using secrets, configurations and volumes on a infrastructure as code file.

1 - We will first create secrets for required PostgreSQL admin user password using _docker service create_:
```
vagrant@swarm-node4:~$ echo SuperSecretPassword|docker secret create postgres_password -
u21mmo1zoqqguh01u8guys9gt
```

We will use it as external secret inside Docker Compose file.

2 - We are going to create a simple initialization script to create a new database when PostgresSQL starts. We will create a simple file on current directory named [create-docker-database.sh](./create-docker-database.sh) with following content and appropiate 755 permissions.
```
#!/bin/bash
set -e
psql -v ON_ERROR_STOP=0 --username "$POSTGRES_USER" --dbname "$POSTGRES_DB"
<<-EOSQL
CREATE USER docker;
CREATE DATABASE docker;
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE docker TO docker;
EOSQL
```
We will add execute permissions:
```
vagrant@swarm-node4:~$ chmod 755 create-docker-database.sh

vagrant@swarm-node4:~$ ls -lrt create-docker-database.sh
-rwxr-xr-x 1 vagrant vagrant 219 Jan 1 20:00 create-docker-database.sh
```

We will then create a config file with file content. We will use this file to create a database named _docker_ on PostgreSQL start. This is something we can use because it is provided by official Docker Hub PostgreSQL image.
```
vagrant@swarm-node4:~$ docker config create create-docker-database ./create-docker-database.sh
uj6zvrdq0682anzr0kobbyhk2
```

3 - We will add a label on some of the nodes to ensure database is running always there as we will create an external volume only on that node. We will use for example _swarm-node2_.
```
$ vagrant ssh swarm-node2
vagrant@swarm-node2:~$ docker volume create PGDATA
PGDATA
```

This volume will only exist on swarm-node2 therefore we will create a constraint based on a node label to run service task only on _swarm-node2_.
```
vagrant@swarm-node4:~$ docker node update --label-add tier=database swarm-node2
swarm-node2
```

4 - Now we will create following Docker Compose file named postgres-stack.yaml:
```
version: '3.7'
services:
  database:
    image: postgres:alpine
    deploy:
      placement:
        constraints:
          - node.role == worker
          - node.labels.tier == database
    environment:
      - POSTGRES_PASSWORD_FILE=/run/secrets/postgres_password
    
    secrets:
      - source: postgres_password
        target: "/run/secrets/postgres_password"  
    
    configs:
      - source: create-docker-database
        target: "/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/create-db.sh"
        mode: 0755
        uid: "0"
    volumes:
      - type: volume
        source: PGDATA
        target: /var/lib/postgresql/data
    ports:
      - target: 5432
        published: 15432
        protocol: tcp
    networks:
      net:
        aliases:
         - postgres
         - mydatabase

configs:
  create-docker-database:
    external: true

secrets:
  postgres_password:
    external: true

volumes:
  PGDATA:
    external: true

networks:
  net:
    driver: overlay
    attachable: true
```

5 - We deploy postgres stack using docker stack deploy:
```
vagrant@swarm-node4:~$ docker stack deploy -c postgres-stack.yaml postgres
Creating network postgres_net
Creating service postgres_database
```

We easely review stack status
```
vagrant@swarm-node4:~$ docker stack ps postgres
ID NAME IMAGE NODE DESIRED STATE CURRENT STATE ERROR PORTS
53in2mik27r0 postgres_database.1 postgres:alpine swarm-node2 Running Running 19 seconds ago
```

It is running on swarm-node2 as we expected.

6 - We published port 5432 on port 15432. We can connect to this port from any node IP address in the cluster because Swarm uses Routing Mesh.
```
vagrant@swarm-node4:~$ curl 0.0.0.0:15432
curl: (52) Empty reply from server

vagrant@swarm-node2:~$ curl 0.0.0.0:15432
curl: (52) Empty reply from server

vagrant@swarm-node3:~$ curl 0.0.0.0:15432
curl: (52) Empty reply from server
```

We get this response to curl because we are not using the right client. Let's run a simple _alpine_ container with postgres client.

7 - We now run a simple alpine container attached to stack deployed network, in this example it is _postgres_net_.
```
vagrant@swarm-node4:~$ docker network ls --filter name=postgres_net
NETWORK ID    NAME         DRIVER   SCOPE
mh53ek97pi3a  postgres_net overlay  swarm
```

We run a simple alpine container and we install postgresql-client package.
```
vagrant@swarm-node4:~$ docker container run -ti --network postgres_net alpine

/ # apk add --update --no-cache postgresql-client --quiet
```

Remember that we added "mydatabase" and "postgres" aliases to "database" service. Therefore any of them will be valid for testing database connectivity because Swarm added these entries on internal DNS.
```
/ # ping -c 1 mydatabase
PING mydatabase (10.0.3.2): 56 data bytes
64 bytes from 10.0.3.2: seq=0 ttl=64 time=0.237 ms

round-trip min/avg/max = 0.159/0.159/0.159 ms
```

We will use installed client to test deployed PostgreSQL. Remember to use previously
defined password created as secret, "SuperSecretPassword".
```
/ # psql -h mydatabase -U postgres
Password for user postgres:
psql (12.1)
Type "help" for help.
postgres=# \l
List of databases
Name | Owner | Encoding | Collate | Ctype | Access privileges
-----------+----------+----------+------------+------------+---------------
--------
docker | postgres | UTF8 | en_US.utf8 | en_US.utf8 | =Tc/postgres +| | | | | postgres=CTc/postgres+ | | | | | docker=CTc/postgres

template1 | postgres | UTF8 | en_US.utf8 | en_US.utf8 | =c/postgres + | | | | | postgres=CTc/postgres
(4 rows)
postgres=#
```

We listed the deployed databases using "\l" and "docker" database, created with our initialization script was created. Notice that we used default PostgreSQL database port 5432 (we omitted any port customization on client request), instead of 15432. This is because docker container was connecting internally. Both, postgres_database.1 task and externally run container, are using the same network, postgres_net.

We will exit running container and remove the postgres stack and swarm-node2 volume for next labs.
```
postgres=# exit
/ # exit
```
Then we will remove deployed stack:
```
vagrant@swarm-node4:~$ docker stack rm postgres
Removing service postgres_database
Removing network postgres_net
```

## __Lab5__: Swarm Ingress Internal Load Balancing

In this lab we will launch a simple replicated service and we will review internal ingress load balacing.

We will use codegazers/colors:1.13 image. This is a simple application that will show different random front page colors or texts.

1 - Let's create a service named _colors_ based on _codegazers/colors:1.13_ image. We will not set any color using environment variables so random ones will be choosen.
```
vagrant@swarm-node4:~$ docker service create --name colors \
--publish 8000:3000 \
--constraint node.role==worker \
codegazers/colors:1.13
mkyz0d94ovb144xmvo0q4py41
overall progress: 1 out of 1 tasks
1/1: running [==================================================>]
verify: Service converged
```
We chose not run any replica on manager node because we will use _curl_ from _swarm-node4_ on this lab.

2 - Let's test connectivity from manager swarm-node4.
```
vagrant@swarm-node4:~$ curl 0.0.0.0:8000/text
APP_VERSION: 1.0
COLOR: orange
CONTAINER_NAME: d3a886d5fe34
CONTAINER_IP: 10.0.0.11 172.18.0.3
CLIENT_IP: ::ffff:10.0.0.5
CONTAINER_ARCH: linux
```

We deployed one replica and it is running "orange" color. Notice container IP address and its name.

3 - Let's run 5 more replicas.
```
vagrant@swarm-node4:~$ docker service update --replicas 6 colors --quiet
colors
```

4 - If we test again service port 8080, we will get different colors as containers were launched without color settings.
```
vagrant@swarm-node4:~$ curl 0.0.0.0:8000/text
APP_VERSION: 1.0
COLOR: red
CONTAINER_NAME: 64fb2a3009b2
CONTAINER_IP: 10.0.0.12 172.18.0.4
CLIENT_IP: ::ffff:10.0.0.5
CONTAINER_ARCH: linux

vagrant@swarm-node4:~$ curl 0.0.0.0:8000/text
APP_VERSION: 1.0
COLOR: cyan
CONTAINER_NAME: 73b07ee0c287
CONTAINER_IP: 10.0.0.14 172.18.0.3
CLIENT_IP: ::ffff:10.0.0.5
CONTAINER_ARCH: linux
```

We get different colors on different containers. Router Mesh is guiding our requests using ingress overlay network to "colors" tasks containers.

5 - Let's execute remove "colors" service for next and final lab.
```
$ docker service rm colors
colors
```

## __Lab6__: Service Discovery

In this lab we will review service endpoint modes and how DNS resolve vip and dnsrr situations. We will create a test overlay attachable network and we will review DNS entries for vip and dnsrr endpoint modes.

1 - We create attachable overaly "test" network.
```
vagrant@swarm-node4:~$ docker network create --attachable -d overlay test
32v9pibk7cqfseknretmyxfsw
```

2 - Now we will create 2 different "colors" services. Each one will use different endpoint modes.
```
vagrant@swarm-node4:~$ docker service create --replicas 2 \
--name colors-vip --network test \
--quiet codegazers/colors:1.13
4m2vvbnqo9wgf8awnf53zr5b2
```

And another one for dnsrr
```
vagrant@swarm-node4:~$ docker service create --replicas 2 \
--name colors-dnsrr --network test \
--quiet --endpoint-mode dnsrr
codegazers/colors:1.13
wqpv929pe5ehniviclzkdvcl0
```

3 - Now run a simple alpine container on _test_ network and verify name resolution. We will install _bind-tools_ package to be able to use _host_ and _nslookup_ tools.
```
vagrant@swarm-node4:~$ docker run -ti --rm --network test alpine
/ # apk add --update --no-cache bind-tools --quiet
/ # host colors-vip
colors-vip has address 10.0.4.2

/ # host colors-dnsrr
colors-dnsrr has address 10.0.4.7
colors-dnsrr has address 10.0.4.8

/ #exit
```

As expected, using __vip__ endpoint mode, service receives a virtual IP address. All request will be redirected to that address and ingress will route to the appropiate container using internal load balancing.

On the other hand, using __dnsrr__ endpoint will not provide any virtual IP address. Internal DNS will add an entry for each container IP.

We can also take a look at containers attached to _test_"_ network. These will get one internal IP address and one that will be routed on overlay network. We have just launched an _ip
add show_"_ command attached to one of the running _colors-dnsrr_"_ task containers.
```
vagrant@swarm-node4:~$ docker exec -ti colors-dnsrr.1.vtmpdf0w82daq6fdyk0wwzqc7
ip add show

Chapter labs

We will now have a lab that will help us to improve the concepts learned.

Deploy "environments/swarm-environment" from book's github repository (https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Docker-Certified-Associate-DCA-Exam-Guide.git) if you have not done yet. You can use your own Linux server. Use vagrant up from "environments/swarm" folder to start your virtual environment.

Wait until all nodes are running. We can check nodes status using vagrant status. Connect to your lab node using vagrant ssh swarm-node1. Vagrant deployed 4 nodes for you and you will be using vagrant user with root privileges using sudo. You should have following output:

Docker-Certified-Associate-DCA-Exam-Guide/environments/swarm$ vagrant up
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

...
Docker-Certified-Associate-DCA-Exam-Guide/environments/swarm$

Nodes will have 3 interfaces (IP addresses and virtual hardware resources can be modified changing config.yml file):

    eth0 [10.0.2.15] - Internal, required for Vagrant.
    eth1 [10.10.10.X/24] - Prepared for Docker Swarm internal communication. First node will get 10.10.10.11 IP address and so on.
    eth2 [192.168.56.X/24] - Host-only interface for communication between your host and the virtual nodes. First node will get 192.168.56.11 IP address and so on.

We will use eth1 interface for Docker Swarm and we will be able to connect to published applications using 192.168.56.X/24 IP addresses range. All nodes have Docker Engine Community Edition installed and vagrant user is allowed to execute docker.

We can now connect to the first deployed virtual node using vagrant ssh swarm-node1. Process may vary if you already deployed Docker Swarm virtual environment before and you just started it using vagrant up.

Docker-Certified-Associate-DCA-Exam-Guide/environments/swarm$ vagrant ssh swarm-node1
vagrant@swarm-node1:~$

Now you are ready to start the labs. Let's start creating a Docker Swarm cluster.
Creating a Docker Swarm cluster

Once Vagrant (or your own environment) is deployed, we will have 4 nodes (named node<index> from 1 to 4) with Ubuntu Xenial and Docker Engine installed.

First review your node IP addresses (10.10.10.11 to 10.10.10.14 if you used Vagrant, because first interface will be Vagrant's internal host-to-node interface). Once you are familiar with the environment's IP addresses, we can initiate a cluster on node1 for example.
Use vssh instead of vagrant ssh to connect to nodes because it will be more familiar with non-Vagrant based real environments.

1 - Connect to node1 and initialize a new cluster using docker swarm init.

Docker-Certified-Associate-DCA-Exam-Guide/environments/swarm$ vagrant ssh swarm-node1
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Docker SWARM MODE Vagrant Environment
 Engine Version: current
 Experimental Features Enabled
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
...
...

vagrant@swarm-node1:~$ docker swarm init
Error response from daemon: could not choose an IP address to advertise since this system has multiple addresses on different interfaces (10.0.2.15 on eth0 and 10.10.10.11 on eth1) - specify one with --advertise-addr

This is normal if you are using Vagrant as nodes at least will have 2 interfaces. First interface is internal for Vagrant while the other is the one fixed for the labs. In this case we will need to specify which interface to use for the cluster with --advertise-addr. We will execute docker swarm init --advertise-addr.

vagrant@swarm-node1:~$ docker swarm init --advertise-addr 10.10.10.11
Swarm initialized: current node (b1t5o5x8mqbz77e9v4ihd7cec) is now a manager.

To add a worker to this swarm, run the following command:

    docker swarm join --token SWMTKN-1-3xfi4qggreh81lbr98d63x7299gtz1fanwfjkselg9ok5wroje-didcmb39w7apwokrah6xx4cus 10.10.10.11:2377

To add a manager to this swarm, run 'docker swarm join-token manager' and follow the instructions.

Now Swarm was initialized correctly.

2 - Add a second node connecting to node2 and executing described command in initialization output. We will join the cluster using docker swarm join command with the obtained token.

Docker-Certified-Associate-DCA-Exam-Guide/environments/swarm$ vagrant ssh swarm-node2

vagrant@swarm-node2:~$ docker swarm join --token SWMTKN-1-3xfi4qggreh81lbr98d63x7299gtz1fanwfjkselg9ok5wroje-didcmb39w7apwokrah6xx4cus 10.10.10.11:2377
This node joined a swarm as a worker.

Node was added as worker.

3 - Verify on node1 that new node was added using docker node ls.

Docker-Certified-Associate-DCA-Exam-Guide/environments/swarm$ vagrant ssh swarm-node1

vagrant@swarm-node1:~$ docker node ls
ID HOSTNAME STATUS AVAILABILITY MANAGER STATUS ENGINE VERSION
b1t5o5x8mqbz77e9v4ihd7cec * swarm-node1 Ready Active Leader 19.03.5
rj3rgb9egnb256cms0zt8pqew swarm-node2 Ready Active 19.03.5

Notice that swarm-node1 is the leader because it is the node that initialized the cluster. We could not execute docker node ls on swarm-node2 because it was not a manager node.

4 - We will execute same joining process on swarm-node3, using  docker swarm join again.

vagrant@swarm-node1:~$ docker node ls
ID HOSTNAME STATUS AVAILABILITY MANAGER STATUS ENGINE VERSION
b1t5o5x8mqbz77e9v4ihd7cec * swarm-node1 Ready Active Leader 19.03.5
rj3rgb9egnb256cms0zt8pqew swarm-node2 Ready Active 19.03.5
ui67xyztnw8kn6fjjezjdtwxd swarm-node3 Ready Active 19.03.5

5 - Now we will review the token for managers so next node will be added as manager. We will use docker swarm join-token manager.

vagrant@swarm-node1:~$ docker swarm join-token manager
To add a manager to this swarm, run the following command:

    docker swarm join --token SWMTKN-1-3xfi4qggreh81lbr98d63x7299gtz1fanwfjkselg9ok5wroje-aidvtmglkdyvvqurnivcsmyzm 10.10.10.11:2377

Now, we connect to swarm-node4 and execute shown joining command (docker swarm join) with the new token.

vagrant@swarm-node4:~$ docker swarm join --token SWMTKN-1-3xfi4qggreh81lbr98d63x7299gtz1fanwfjkselg9ok5wroje-aidvtmglkdyvvqurnivcsmyzm 10.10.10.11:2377
This node joined a swarm as a manager

6 - Cluster now have 4 nodes, 2 managers and 2 workers. This will not provide high availability if Leader fails. Let's promote swarm-node2 to manager too for example executing docker node update --role manager.

vagrant@swarm-node4:~$ docker node update --role manager swarm-node2
swarm-node2

We can change node roles using "promote" and "demote" commands also, but it is more convenient to know what they really mean for node properties updates. Also notice that we can change node roles whenever we want but we should maintain the number of healthy managers.

And we can review node status again. Managers are shown as "Reachable" or "Leader", indicating that this node is the cluster leader. Using docker node ls.

vagrant@swarm-node4:~$ docker node ls
ID HOSTNAME STATUS AVAILABILITY MANAGER STATUS ENGINE VERSION
b1t5o5x8mqbz77e9v4ihd7cec swarm-node1 Ready Active Leader 19.03.5
rj3rgb9egnb256cms0zt8pqew swarm-node2 Ready Active Reachable 19.03.5
ui67xyztnw8kn6fjjezjdtwxd swarm-node3 Ready Active 19.03.5
jw9uvjcsyg05u1slm4wu0hz6l * swarm-node4 Ready Active Reachable 19.03.5

Notice that we executed these commands on node4. We can do it because it is a manager (not leader but manager). We can use any manager to manage the cluster, but only leader will do the updates on internal database.

7 - We will just leave one manager for the rest of the Labs, but first we will kill node1 Docker Engine Daemon to see what happens in the cluster. We will stop Docker daemon using systemctl stop docker.

Docker-Certified-Associate-DCA-Exam-Guide/environments/swarm$ vagrant ssh swarm-node1

vagrant@swarm-node1:~$ sudo systemctl stop docker

Connecting to other manager (node2 for example, recently promoted node). We will review node status with docker node ls.

Docker-Certified-Associate-DCA-Exam-Guide/environments/swarm$ vagrant ssh swarm-node2

vagrant@swarm-node2$ docker node ls
ID HOSTNAME STATUS AVAILABILITY MANAGER STATUS ENGINE VERSION
b1t5o5x8mqbz77e9v4ihd7cec swarm-node1 Down Active Unreachable 19.03.5
rj3rgb9egnb256cms0zt8pqew * swarm-node2 Ready Active Reachable 19.03.5
ui67xyztnw8kn6fjjezjdtwxd swarm-node3 Ready Active 19.03.5
jw9uvjcsyg05u1slm4wu0hz6l swarm-node4 Ready Active Leader 19.03.5

New leader was elected from other running managers.

We now start again node1 Docker Engine Daemon using systemctl start docker.

Docker-Certified-Associate-DCA-Exam-Guide/environments/swarm$ vagrant ssh swarm-node1

vagrant@swarm-node1$ sudo systemctl start docker

vagrant@swarm-node1$ docker node ls
ID HOSTNAME STATUS AVAILABILITY MANAGER STATUS ENGINE VERSION
b1t5o5x8mqbz77e9v4ihd7cec * swarm-node1 Ready Active Reachable 19.03.5
rj3rgb9egnb256cms0zt8pqew swarm-node2 Ready Active Reachable 19.03.5
ui67xyztnw8kn6fjjezjdtwxd swarm-node3 Ready Active 19.03.5
jw9uvjcsyg05u1slm4wu0hz6l swarm-node4 Ready Active Leader 19.03.5

Node remains as manager but it is not now the leader of the cluster because a new one was elected when it failed.

8 - Let's demote all non-leader nodes to workers for the rest of the labs using docker node update --role worker.

vagrant@swarm-node1$ docker node update --role worker swarm-node2
swarm-node2

vagrant@swarm-node1:~$ docker node update --role worker swarm-node1
swarm-node1

vagrant@swarm-node1:~$ docker node ls
Error response from daemon: This node is not a swarm manager. Worker nodes can't be used to view or modify cluster state. Please run this command on a manager node or promote the current node to a manager.

Notice the error when listing again. Node1 is not manager now hence we can not manage the cluster from this node anymore. All management commands will run now from node4 for the rest of the labs. Node4 is the only manager hence it is the cluster leader as we can observe using docker node ls again.

Docker-Certified-Associate-DCA-Exam-Guide/environments/swarm$ vagrant ssh swarm-node4

vagrant@swarm-node4:~$ docker node ls
ID                            HOSTNAME      STATUS    AVAILABILITY    MANAGER STATUS    ENGINE VERSION

rj3rgb9egnb256cms0zt8pqew     swarm-node2    Ready    Active                            19.03.5
ui67xyztnw8kn6fjjezjdtwxd     swarm-node3    Ready    Active                            19.03.5
jw9uvjcsyg05u1slm4wu0hz6l *   swarm-node4    Ready    Active        Leader              19.03.5

On next lab we will deploy a simple webserver service.
Deploy a simple replicated service

From swarm-node4, we will create a replicated service (by default) and test how we can distribute more replicas on different nodes.

1 - Deploy "webserver" service using a simple nginx:alpine image executing docker service create.

vagrant@swarm-node4:~$ docker service create --name webserver nginx:alpine
kh906v3xg1ni98xk466kk48p4
overall progress: 1 out of 1 tasks 
1/1: running [==================================================>] 
verify: Service converged 

Notice that we waited few seconds until all instances are correctly running. Time may vary if image has some configured healthcheck.
We can overwrite image defined healthcheks on service creation or updating its configuration using --health-cmd and other related arguments. In fact we can change almost everything on used image as we did with containers.

2 - Once it is deployed we can review where replica was started using docker service ps.

vagrant@swarm-node4:~$ docker service ps webserver
ID                  NAME                IMAGE               NODE                DESIRED STATE       CURRENT STATE            ERROR               PORTS
wb4knzpud1z5        webserver.1         nginx:alpine        swarm-node3               Running             Running 14 seconds ago                                         

In this case nginx was deployed on node4. This may vary in your environment.

3 - We can scale the number of replicas to 3 and review how they were distributed. We will use docker service update --replicas.

$ docker service update --replicas 3 webserver
webserver
overall progress: 3 out of 3 tasks 
1/3: running [==================================================>] 
2/3: running [==================================================>] 
3/3: running [==================================================>] 
verify: Service converged 

If we review replicas distribution we will discover where containers are running using docker service ps webserver.

vagrant@swarm-node4:~$ docker service ps webserver
ID NAME IMAGE NODE DESIRED STATE CURRENT STATE ERROR PORTS
wb4knzpud1z5 webserver.1 nginx:alpine swarm-node3 Running Running 2 minutes ago 
ie9br2pblxu6 webserver.2 nginx:alpine swarm-node4 Running Running 50 seconds ago 
9d021pmvnnrq webserver.3 nginx:alpine swarm-node1 Running Running 50 seconds ago 

We notice in this case that swarm-node2 did not receive any replica. But we can force replicas to run there.

4 - To force specific locations we can add labels to specific nodes and add constraints to nodes. We add a label using docker node update --label-add.

vagrant@swarm-node4:~$ docker node update --label-add tier=front swarm-node2
swarm-node2

And now we modify the current service to run on specific nodes, labeled tier==front. We will use docker service update --constraint-add node.labels.tier and then we will review again its distributed tasks with docker service ps.

vagrant@swarm-node4:~$ docker service update --constraint-add node.labels.tier==front webserver
webserver
overall progress: 3 out of 3 tasks 
1/3: running   [==================================================>] 
2/3: running   [==================================================>] 
3/3: running   [==================================================>] 
verify: Service converged 

vagrant@swarm-node4:~$ docker service ps webserver

Now all replicas are running on swarm-node2.

5 - Now we will do some maintenance tasks on node2. In this situation we will remove service constraint before draining swarm-node2. If we do not do that, no other node will receive workloads because they are restricted to tier=front node labels. We removed the service's constraints using docker service update --constraint-rm node.labels.tier.

vagrant@swarm-node4:~$ docker service update --constraint-rm node.labels.tier==front webserver

Tasks did not move to other nodes because tasks were already satisfying service constraints (no constraint in the new situation).
Docker Swarm will never move tasks if it is not really necessary because it will try always to avoid any service disruption. We can force service tasks redistribution forcing update using docker service update --force <SERVICE_NAME>.

6 - On this step we will pause swarm-node3 and drain swarm-node2. We will use docker node update --availability pause and docker node update --availability drain, respectively.

vagrant@swarm-node4:~$ docker node update --availability pause swarm-node3
swarm-node3

vagrant@swarm-node4:~$ docker node update --availability drain swarm-node2
swarm-node2

Now, let's review service replica distribution again using docker service ps.

vagrant@swarm-node4:~$ docker service ps webserver --filter desired-state=running
ID                  NAME                IMAGE               NODE                DESIRED STATE       CURRENT STATE           ERROR               PORTS
6z55nch0q8ai        webserver.1         nginx:alpine        swarm-node4               Running             Running 3 minutes ago                       
8il59udc4iey        webserver.2         nginx:alpine        swarm-node4               Running             Running 3 minutes ago                       
1y4q96hb3hik        webserver.3         nginx:alpine        swarm-node1               Running             Running 3 minutes ago      

Notice that only swarm-node1 and swarm-node4 get some tasks because swarm-node3 is paused and we removed all tasks on swarm-node2.
We can use docker node ps <NODE> to get all tasks from all services running on specified node.

7 - We will remove webserver service and enable nodes node2 and node3 again. We will execute docker service rm to remove the service.

vagrant@swarm-node4:~$ docker service rm webserver
webserver

vagrant@swarm-node4:~$ docker node update --availability active swarm-node2
swarm-node2

vagrant@swarm-node4:~$ docker node update --availability active swarm-node3
swarm-node3

On next lab we will create a global service.
Deploy a global service

1 - We learned that global services will deploy one replica on each node. Let's create one and review its distribution. We will use docker service create  --mode global.

vagrant@swarm-node4:~$ docker service create --name webserver --mode global nginx:alpine

All nodes will receive their own replica as we can see with docker service ps.

2 - We will now drain swarm-node1 for example and review the new tasks distribution. We will drain the node using docker node update --availability drain.

vagrant@swarm-node4:~$ docker node update --availability drain swarm-node1
swarm-node1

vagrant@swarm-node4:~$ docker service ps webserver --filter desired-state=running

None received swarm-node1 task because global services will only run one replica of defined service.

3 - If we enable again swarm-node1 using docker node update --availability active, its replica will start to run again.

vagrant@swarm-node4:~$ docker node update --availability active swarm-node1
node1
vagrant@swarm-node4:~$ docker service ps webserver --filter desired-state=running

Swarm will run one tasks of any global service on each node. When a new node joins the cluster, it will also receive one replica of each global service defined in the cluster.

4 - We will remove webserver service again to clear cluster for the next labs using docker service rm webserver.

vagrant@swarm-node4:~$ docker service rm webserver
webserver

We will now take a quick look to service update to learn how to update service base image for example.
Update service's base image

We will quick and easy refresh a new image version of deployed and running service without user access interruption.

1-First we created a 6 replicas webserver service using docker service create --replicas 6.

vagrant@swarm-node4:~$ docker service create --name webserver \
--replicas 6 --update-delay 10s --update-order start-first \
nginx:alpine

5/6: running   [==================================================>] 
6/6: running   [==================================================>] 
verify: Service converged 

2 - We update now to an specific nginx:alpine version with perl support for example. We use docker service update --image to change only its base image.

vagrant@swarm-node4:~$ docker service update --image nginx:alpine-perl webserver
webserver
overall progress: 6 out of 6 tasks

verify: Service converged 

Update took more than 60 seconds because Swarm updated tasks one by one in 10 seconds intervals. It will first start the new container with the new defined image. Once it is healthy, it will stop old version container. This must be done on each task therefore takes more time but we can ensure that there were always a webserver task running. In this example we have not publish webserver ports so no user interaction was expected. It is just a simple lab but real life environment will be the same and internal Docker Swarm load balancing will always guide user's requests to alive instances while update is running.

New version is running now as we can observe using docker service ps again.

vagrant@swarm-node4:~$ docker service ps webserver --filter desired-state=running

3 - We will remove webserver service again to clear cluster for the next labs using docker service rm.

vagrant@swarm-node4:~$ docker service rm webserver
webserver

On next lab we will deploy applications using stacks instead of creating services manually which can guide us to configuration errors for example. Using stacks will provide environment reproducibility because we will always run same infrastructure as code definitions.
Deploying using Docker Stacks

In this lab we will deploy a PostgreSQL database using secrets, configurations and volumes on a infrastructure as code file.

1 - We will first create secrets for required PostgreSQL admin user password. We will execute docker service create with standard input as secret content.

vagrant@swarm-node4:~$ echo SuperSecretPassword|docker secret create postgres_password -
u21mmo1zoqqguh01u8guys9gt

We will use it as external secret inside Docker Compose file.

2 - We are going to create a simple initialization script to create a new database when PostgresSQL starts. We will create a simple file on current directory named create-docker-database.sh with following content and appropriate 755 permissions. This file should have following content:

#!/bin/bash
set -e

psql -v ON_ERROR_STOP=0 --username "$POSTGRES_USER" --dbname "$POSTGRES_DB" <<-EOSQL
    CREATE USER docker;
    CREATE DATABASE docker;
    GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE docker TO docker;
EOSQL

We will then create a config file with file content. We will use this file to create a database named "docker" on PostgreSQL start. This is something we can use because it is provided by official Docker Hub PostgreSQL image. We will use docker config create with create-docker-database.sh file.

vagrant@swarm-node4:~$ docker config create create-docker-database ./create-docker-database.sh
uj6zvrdq0682anzr0kobbyhk2

3 - We will add a label on some of the nodes to ensure database is running always there as we will create an external volume only on that node. We will use for example node2. We will create a volume using docker volume create.

Docker-Certified-Associate-DCA-Exam-Guide/environments/swarm$ vagrant ssh swarm-node2

vagrant@swarm-node2:~$ docker volume create PGDATA
PGDATA

This volume will only exist on swarm-node2 therefore we will create a constraint based on a node label to run service task only on swarm-node2. We use docker node update --label-add tier=database.
This is a simple sample. On your production environment you will never use local volumes. We will need to define and use some plugin that allows sharing same volume on different hosts, such as NFS, RexRay, etc...

vagrant@swarm-node4:~$ docker node update --label-add tier=database swarm-node2
swarm-node2

4 - Now we will create following Docker Compose file named postgres-stack.yaml:

version: '3.7'
services:
  database:
    image: postgres:alpine
    deploy:
      placement:
        constraints:
          - node.role == worker
          - node.labels.tier == database
    environment:
      - POSTGRES_PASSWORD_FILE=/run/secrets/postgres_password
    
    secrets:
      - source: postgres_password
        target: "/run/secrets/postgres_password" 
    
    configs:
      - source: create-docker-database
        target: "/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/create-db.sh"
        mode: 0755
        uid: "0"
    volumes:
      - type: volume
        source: PGDATA
        target: /var/lib/postgresql/data
    ports:
      - target: 5432
        published: 15432
        protocol: tcp
    networks:
      net:
        aliases:
         - postgres
         - mydatabase

configs:
  create-docker-database:
    external: true

secrets:
  postgres_password:
    external: true

volumes:
  PGDATA:
    external: true

networks:
  net:
    driver: overlay
    attachable: true

Notice a few things on this file because we added lot of learned information here:

    We defined postgres:alpine image for "database" service.
    "database" service will only be scheduled on worker nodes with a label key "tier" and value "database". In this case it will run tasks only on node2.
    Postgres image can use Docker Swarm secret files as environment variables, and in this case it will use postgres_password mounted on /run/secrets/postgres_password. Secret is declared externally because it was previously created, out of this file.
    We added a config file too to create a initial database called "docker". Config file is external too because we added it out of postgres-stack.yaml file.
    We added also an external volume named "PGDATA". We will use this volume for the database but it will only exist on node2. It is defined as external because we manually create PGDATA volume locally on node2.
    We published PostgreSQL application port 5432 on hosts 15432. We changed the published port to notice that they were not the same because 5432 will be internal on the defined network named "net".
    Finally, we defined "net" network attachable to be able to test our database with a simple container running a postgres client. We added two aliases to "database" service inside this network, "postgres" and "mydatabase".

Notice that all objects created for the stack will use stack's name as prefix. This will not happen on external defined objects. They will be used, but we created them manually, out of stack life-cycle.

5 - We deploy postgres stack using docker stack deploy:

vagrant@swarm-node4:~$ docker stack deploy -c postgres-stack.yaml postgres
Creating network postgres_net
Creating service postgres_database

We easily review stack status using docker stack ps.

vagrant@swarm-node4:~$ docker stack ps postgres
ID NAME IMAGE NODE DESIRED STATE CURRENT STATE ERROR PORTS
53in2mik27r0 postgres_database.1 postgres:alpine swarm-node2 Running Running 19 seconds ago 

It is running on swarm-node2 as we expected.

6 - We published port 5432 on port 15432. We can connect to this port from any node IP address in the cluster because Swarm uses Routing Mesh. We use curl command to review port's availability.

vagrant@swarm-node4:~$ curl 0.0.0.0:15432
curl: (52) Empty reply from server

vagrant@swarm-node2:~$ curl 0.0.0.0:15432
curl: (52) Empty reply from server

vagrant@swarm-node3:~$ curl 0.0.0.0:15432
curl: (52) Empty reply from server

We get this response to curl because we are not using the right software client (but ports are listening). Let's run a simple alpine container with postgres client.

7 - We now run a simple alpine container attached to stack deployed network, in this example it is "postgres_net".

vagrant@swarm-node4:~$ docker network ls --filter name=postgres_net
NETWORK ID NAME DRIVER SCOPE
mh53ek97pi3a postgres_net overlay swarm

We run a simple alpine container and we install postgresql-client package using docker container run with apropiate network.

vagrant@swarm-node4:~$ docker container run -ti --network postgres_net alpine

Remember that we added "mydatabase" and "postgres" aliases to "database" service. Therefore any of them will be valid for testing database connectivity because Swarm added these entries on internal DNS. We can test this running a simple ping command inside the container.

/ # ping -c 1 mydatabase
PING mydatabase (10.0.3.2): 56 data bytes
64 bytes from 10.0.3.2: seq=0 ttl=64 time=0.237 ms

We will use installed client to test deployed PostgreSQL. Remember to use previously defined password created as secret, "SuperSecretPassword". We will test database conectivity using psql command.

/ # psql -h mydatabase -U postgres
Password for user postgres: 
psql (12.1)
Type "help" for help.

We listed the deployed databases using "\l" and "docker" database, created with our initialization script was created. Notice that we used default PostgreSQL database port 5432 (we omitted any port customization on client request), instead of 15432. This is because docker container was connecting internally. Both, postgres_database.1 task and externally run container, are using the same network, postgres_net.
Notice that we can use all learned options with stack created service, "postgres_database". Anyway, we can modify Compose file and redeploy again same satck with changes. Swarm will review required updates and take necessary actions on all components.

We will exit running container executing exit command and then we will remove the postgres stack and node2 volume for next labs using docker stack rm.

postgres=# exit
/ # exit

vagrant@swarm-node4:~$ docker stack rm postgres
Removing service postgres_database
Removing network postgres_net

On next lab we will launch a simple replicated service and we will review internal ingress load balacing.
Swarm ingress internal load balancing

In this lab we will use codegazers/colors:1.13 image. This is a simple application that will show different random front page colors or texts.

1 - Let's create a service named "colors" based on codegazers/colors:1.13 image. We will not set any color using environment variables so random ones will be chosen. We will use docker service create --constraint node.role==worker.

vagrant@swarm-node4:~$ docker service create --name colors \
 --publish 8000:3000 \
--constraint node.role==worker \
codegazers/colors:1.13

overall progress: 1 out of 1 tasks 
1/1: running [==================================================>] 
verify: Service converged 

We chose not run any replica on manager node because we will use curl from node4 on this lab.

2 - Let's test local connectivity from manager swarm-node4 with curl.

vagrant@swarm-node4:~$ curl 0.0.0.0:8000/text
APP_VERSION: 1.0
COLOR: orange
CONTAINER_NAME: d3a886d5fe34
CONTAINER_IP: 10.0.0.11 172.18.0.3
CLIENT_IP: ::ffff:10.0.0.5
CONTAINER_ARCH: linux

We deployed one replica and it is running "orange" color. Notice container IP address and its name.

3 - Let's run 5 more replicas executing docker service update --replicas 6.

vagrant@swarm-node4:~$ docker service update --replicas 6 colors --quiet
colors

4 - If we test again service port 8080 with curl, we will get different colors as containers were launched without color settings.

vagrant@swarm-node4:~$ curl 0.0.0.0:8000/text
APP_VERSION: 1.0
COLOR: red
CONTAINER_NAME: 64fb2a3009b2
CONTAINER_IP: 10.0.0.12 172.18.0.4
CLIENT_IP: ::ffff:10.0.0.5
CONTAINER_ARCH: linux

vagrant@swarm-node4:~$ curl 0.0.0.0:8000/text
APP_VERSION: 1.0
COLOR: cyan
CONTAINER_NAME: 73b07ee0c287
CONTAINER_IP: 10.0.0.14 172.18.0.3
CLIENT_IP: ::ffff:10.0.0.5
CONTAINER_ARCH: linux

We get different colors on different containers. Router Mesh is guiding our requests using ingress overlay network to "colors" tasks containers.
We can access all "colors" service tasks logs using docker service logs colors.

5 - Let's execute remove "colors" service for next and final lab using docker service rm.

vagranr@swarm-node4:~$ docker service rm colors
colors

On next lab we will review service endpoint modes and how DNS resolve vip and dnsrr situations.
Service discovery

In this lab we will create a test overlay attachable network and we will review DNS entries for vip and dnsrr endpoint modes.

1 - We create attachable overaly "test" network using docker network create --attachable -d overlay.

vagrant@swarm-node4:~$ docker network create --attachable -d overlay test

2 - Now we will create 2 different "colors" services. Each one will use different endpoint modes. For vip mode we will use docker service create.

vagrant@swarm-node4:~$ docker service create --replicas 2 \
--name colors-vip --network test --quiet codegazers/colors:1.13
4m2vvbnqo9wgf8awnf53zr5b2

And another one for dnsrr, using docker service create --endpoint-mode dnsrr.

vagrant@swarm-node4:~$ docker service create --replicas 2 \
--name colors-dnsrr --network test --quiet --endpoint-mode dnsrr codegazers/colors:1.13
wqpv929pe5ehniviclzkdvcl0

3 - Now run a simple alpine container on "test" network using docker container run and we will test internal name resolution. We will install bind-tools package to be able to use host and nslookup tools.

vagrant@swarm-node4:~$ docker run -ti --rm --network test alpine 
/ # apk add --update --no-cache bind-tools --quiet
/ # host colors-vip
colors-vip has address 10.0.4.2
/ # host colors-dnsrr
colors-dnsrr has address 10.0.4.7
colors-dnsrr has address 10.0.4.8
/ #exit

As expected, using vip endpoint mode, service receives a virtual IP address. All request will be redirected to that address and ingress will route to the appropiate container using internal load balancing.

On the other hand, using dnsrr endpoint will not provide any virtual IP address. Internal DNS will add an entry for each container IP.

We can also take a look at containers attached to "test" network. These will get one internal IP address and one that will be routed on overlay network. We have just launched an ip add show command attached to one of the running "colors-dnsrr" task containers. We review their IP addresses using docker container exec on running container.

vagrant@swarm-node4:~$ docker exec -ti colors-dnsrr.1.vtmpdf0w82daq6fdyk0wwzqc7 ip add show
1: lo: <LOOPBACK,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 65536 qdisc noqueue state UNKNOWN qlen 1
    link/loopback 00:00:00:00:00:00 brd 00:00:00:00:00:00
    inet 127.0.0.1/8 scope host lo
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
111: eth0@if112: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP,M-DOWN> mtu 1450 qdisc noqueue state UP 
    link/ether 02:42:0a:00:04:07 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
    inet 10.0.4.7/24 brd 10.0.4.255 scope global eth0
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
113: eth1@if114: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP,M-DOWN> mtu 1500 qdisc noqueue state UP 
    link/ether 02:42:ac:12:00:04 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
    inet 172.18.0.4/16 brd 172.18.255.255 scope global eth1
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever

All Vagrant environment can easily be removed executing vagrant destroy -f to remove all previously created nodes for this lab. This command should be executed on your "environments/swam" local directory.

Remove all services created for this last lab with docker service rm colors-dnsrr colors-vip.
