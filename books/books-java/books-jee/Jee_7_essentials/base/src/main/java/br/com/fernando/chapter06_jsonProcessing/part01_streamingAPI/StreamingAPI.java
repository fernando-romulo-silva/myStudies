    // The API provides an event-based parser and allows an application developer to ask for the next event (i.e., pull the event),
    // rather than handling the event in a callback.
    //
    // This gives a developer more procedural control over processing of the JSON.
    //
    // The streaming API is a low-level API designed to process large amounts of JSON data efficiently. 
    // Other JSON frameworks (such as JSON binding) can be implemented with this API.
