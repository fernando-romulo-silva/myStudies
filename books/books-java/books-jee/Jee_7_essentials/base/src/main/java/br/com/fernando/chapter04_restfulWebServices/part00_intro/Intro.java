    // REST is an architectural style of services that utilizes web standards. Web services designed using REST are called RESTful web services, 
    // and their main principles are:
    //
    // * Everything can be identified as a resource, and each resource can be uniquely identified by a URI.
    //
    // * A resource can be represented in multiple formats, defined by a media type. The media type will provide enough information on how the requested 
    // format needs to be generated. Standard methods are defined for the client and server to negotiate on the content type of the resource.
    //
    // * Use standard HTTP methods to interact with the resource: GET to retrieve a resource, POST to create a resource, PUT to update a resource, 
    // and DELETE to remove a resource.
    //
    // * Communication between the client and the endpoint is stateless. All the associated state required by the server is passed by the client in 
    // each invocation.
