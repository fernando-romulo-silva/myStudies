    // Which is a valid description of REST?
    //
    // Choice A
    // REST provides the same architectural properties as SOAP.
    //
    // Choice B
    // REST is a library that is part of JEE called JAX-RS.
    //
    // Choice C
    // REST is the conventional way of interacting with information resources.
    //
    // Choice D
    // REST is a Web Services standard supported by JEE and JAX-RS.
    //
    //
    //

    //
    //
    //
    //
    //
    //
    //
    //
    //
    // Choice D is correct.
    //
    // RESTful web services are built to work best on the Web.
    // Representational State Transfer (REST) is an architectural style that specifies constraints, such as the uniform interface,
    // that if applied to a web service induce desirable properties, such as performance, scalability, and modifiability, that enable services to work best on the Web.
    //
    // In the REST architectural style, data and functionality are considered resources and are accessed using Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs), typically links on the Web.
    // The resources are acted upon by using a set of simple, well-defined operations.
    // The REST architectural style constrains an architecture to a client/server architecture and is designed to use a stateless communication protocol, typically HTTP.
    // In the REST architecture style, clients and servers exchange representations of resources by using a standardized interface and protocol.
    //
    // JAX-RS is part of JEE.
    //
    // JAX-RS is Java API for RESTful Web Services is a Java programming language API spec that provides support in creating web services according
    // to the Representational State Transfer architectural pattern.
