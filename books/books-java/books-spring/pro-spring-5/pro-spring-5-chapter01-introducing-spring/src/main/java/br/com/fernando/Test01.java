    // In the context of DI, Spring acts more like a container than a framework—providing instances of your application classes with all the
    // dependencies they need—but it does so in a much less intrusive way. Using Spring for DI relies on nothing more than following the JavaBeans
    // naming conventions within your classes—there are no special classes from which to inherit or proprietary naming schemes to follow.
