=== Observation

Gradle 5.x supports annotation processors. IntelliJ IDEA does too, but they must be enabled for the project.
Go to IntelliJ IDEA menu > Build, Execution, Deployment > Compiler > Annotation Processor.

On the right check `Enable annotation processing` and make sure `Obtain processors from project classpath` is selected.

Even if IntelliJ will complain about classes missing, the tests still can be run.
