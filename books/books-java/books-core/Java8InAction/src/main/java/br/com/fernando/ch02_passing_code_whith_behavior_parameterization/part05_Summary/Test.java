// Summary
public class Test {

    //  Behavior parameterization is the ability for a method to take multiple different behaviors as parameters and use them internally to accomplish different behaviors.
    //
    //  Behavior parameterization lets you make your code more adaptive to changing requirements and saves on engineering efforts in the future.
    //
    //  Passing code is a way to give new behaviors as arguments to a method. But it’s verbose prior to Java 8. Anonymous classes helped a bit before Java 8
    // to get rid of the verbosity associated with declaring multiple concrete classes for an interface that are needed only once.
    //
    //  The Java API contains many methods that can be parameterized with different behaviors, which include sorting, threads, and GUI handling.
