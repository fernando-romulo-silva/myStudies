// Summary
public class Test {

    //  Lambda expressions can make your code more readable and flexible.
    //
    //  Consider converting anonymous classes to lambda expressions, but be wary of subtle semantic
    // differences such as the meaning of the keyword this and shadowing of variables.
    //
    //  Method references can make your code more readable compared to lambda expressions.
    //
    //  Consider converting iterative collection processing to use the Streams API.
    //
    //  Lambda expressions can help remove boilerplate code associated with several object-oriented design
    // patterns such as strategy, template method, observer, chain of responsibility, and factory.
    //
    //  Lambda expressions can be unit tested, but in general you should focus on testing the behavior of the
    // methods where the lambda expressions appear.
    //
    //  Consider extracting complex lambda expressions into regular methods.  Lambda expressions can make stack traces less readable.
    //
    //  The peek method of a stream is useful to log intermediate values as they flow past at certain points in
    // a stream pipeline.
