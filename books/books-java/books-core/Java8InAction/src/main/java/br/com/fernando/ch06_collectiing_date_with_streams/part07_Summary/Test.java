    //  collect is a terminal operation that takes as argument various recipes (called collectors) for
    // accumulating the elements of a stream into a summary result. 
    // 
    //  Predefined collectors include reducing and summarizing stream elements into a single value, such as
    // calculating the minimum, maximum, or average. Those collectors are summarized in table 6.1. 
    // 
    //  Predefined collectors let you group elements of a stream with groupingBy and partition elements of a
    // stream with partitioningBy. 
    // 
    //  Collectors compose effectively to create multilevel groupings, partitions, and reductions. 
    // 
    //  You can develop your own collectors by implementing the methods defined in the Collector interface
