//  Summary
public class Test {

    //  The Streams API lets you express complex data processing queries. Common stream operations are
    // summarized in table 5.1. 
    // 
    //  You can filter and slice a stream using the filter, distinct, skip, and limit methods. 
    // 
    //  You can extract or transform elements of a stream using the map and flatMap methods. 
    // 
    //  You can find elements in a stream using the findFirst and findAny methods. You can match a given
    // predicate in a stream using the allMatch, noneMatch, and anyMatch methods.
    // 
    //  These methods make use of short-circuiting: a computation stops as soon as a result is found; there’s
    // no need to process the whole stream. 
    // 
    //  You can combine all elements of a stream iteratively to produce a result using the reduce method, for
    // example, to calculate the sum or find the maximum of a stream. 
    // 
    //  Some operations such as filter and map are stateless; they don’t store any state. Some operations
    // such as reduce store state to calculate a value. Some operations such as sorted and distinct also
    // store state because they need to buffer all the elements of a stream before returning a new stream.
    // Such operations are called stateful operations
    // 
    // 
    //  There are three primitive specializations of streams: IntStream, DoubleStream, and LongStream. Their operations are also specialized accordingly. 
    // 
    //  Streams can be created not only from a collection but also from values, arrays, files, and specific
    // methods such as iterate and generate. 
    // 
    //  An infinite stream is a stream that has no fixed size.
