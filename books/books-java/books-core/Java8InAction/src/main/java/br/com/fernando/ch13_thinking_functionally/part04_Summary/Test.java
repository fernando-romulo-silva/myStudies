public class Test {

    //  Reducing shared mutable data structures can help you maintain and debug your programs in the long term.
    //
    //  Functional-style programming promotes side-effect-free methods and declarative programming.
    //
    //  Function-style methods are characterized only by their input arguments and their output result.
    //
    //  A function is referentially transparent if it always returns the same result value when called with the
    // same argument value. Iterative constructs such as while loops can be replaced by recursion.
    //
    //  Tail recursion may be a better practice than classic recursion in Java because it opens the way to
    // eventual compiler optimization.
