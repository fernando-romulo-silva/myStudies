	// In Java, recursive forms are typically less efficient
	//
	// In general, making a recursive function call is much more expensive than the single machine-level branch
	// instruction needed to iterate. Why? Every time the factorialRecursive function is called, a new
	// stack frame is created on the call stack to hold the state of each function call (the multiplication
	// it needs to do) until the recursion is done. This means your recursive definition of factorial will
	// take memory proportional to its input.
	//
	// Tail-recursive factorial
	//
	// The function factorialHelper is tail recursive because the recursive call is the last thing that
	// happens in the function. By contrast in our previous definition of factorial-Recursive, the last
	// thing was a multiplication of n and the result of a recursive call.
	//
	// The bad news is that Java doesnâ€™t support this kind of optimization. But adopting tail recursion
	// may be a better practice than classic recursion because it opens the way to eventual compiler
	// optimization. Many modern JVM languages such as Scala and Groovy can optimize those uses of
	// recursion, which are equivalent to iteration
