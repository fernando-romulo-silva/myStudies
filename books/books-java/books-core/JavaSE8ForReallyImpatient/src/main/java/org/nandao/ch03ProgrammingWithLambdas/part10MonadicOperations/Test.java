// When you work with generic types, and with functions that yield values
// from these types, it is useful to supply methods that let you compose these
// functionsâ€”that is, carry out one after another. In this section, you will see a
// design pattern for providing such compositions.
//
// Consider a generic type G<T> with one type parameter, such as List<T> (zero or
// more values of type T), Optional<T> (zero or one values of type T), or Future<T> (a
// value of type T that will be available in the future).
// Also consider a function T -> U, or a Function<T, U> object.
