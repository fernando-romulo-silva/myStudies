    // The AWT had a noble idea: provide a common programming interface for the
    // native buttons, sliders, text fields, and so on of various operating systems. But it
    // didn’t work very well.
    //
    // Next came Swing. The central idea behind Swing was not to use the native widgets,
    // but to paint its own. That way, the user interface would look and feel the
    // same on every platform. Or, if users preferred, they could ask for the native look
    // and feel of their platform, and the Swing widgets would be painted to match
    // the native ones. Of course, all that painting was slow, and users complained.
    // After a while, computers got faster, and users complained that Swing was
    // ugly—indeed, it had fallen behind the native widgets that had been spruced up
    // with animations and fancy effects. 
    //
    // In 2007, Sun Microsystems introduced a new technology, called JavaFX, as a
    // competitor to Flash. It ran on the Java VM but had its own programming language,
    // called JavaFX Script. The language was optimized for programming animations
    // and fancy effects. Programmers complained about the need to learn a
    // new language, and they stayed away in droves. In 2011, Oracle released a new
    // version, JavaFX 2.0, that had a Java API and no longer needed a separate programming
    // language. As of Java 7 update 6, JavaFX 2.2 has been bundled with
    // the JDK and JRE. Since it wouldn’t be a true part of Java if it didn’t have crazy
    // jumps in version numbers, the version accompanying Java 8 is called JavaFX 8.
