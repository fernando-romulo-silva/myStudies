    // Java EE7 - JAX-RS with Jersey
    //
    // Java EE 7 with JAX-RS 2.0 brings several useful features, which further simplify the development of microservices.
    // One of the most important new features of JAX-RS 2.0 is the support for hypermedia following the HATEOAS principle of REST.
    // Jersey, a library from Oracle, is probably the most widely known library, which implements this specification.
    //
    // JAX-RS supports the creation of XML and JSON via the Java Architecture for XML Binding (JAXB).
    //
    //
    // Spring Boot
    //
    // Spring Framework provides a lot of features that can make a developer's life easier out of the box and allows you to deliver
    // needed features faster. The list is long; here are just a few examples:
    //
    // * Spring data: Simplifies data access from relational and NoSQL data stores
    //
    // * Spring batch: Provides a powerful batch processing framework
    //
    // * Spring security: Provides numerous ways to secure applications
    //
    // * Spring social: Supports integration with social networking sites such as Twitter, Facebook, GitHub, and so on
    //
    // * Spring integration: An implementation of enterprise integration patterns to facilitate integration with other
    // enterprise applications using lightweight messaging and declarative adapters
    //
