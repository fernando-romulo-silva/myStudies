	// Having an application deployed on a Kubernetes cluster has its advantages.
	// It's fail resilient, scalable, and has efficient architecture.
	// What's the difference between having your own infrastructure and using the cloud?
	//
	// First, it can be a significant cost reduction.
	// For small services or applications, which could be shut down when not in use, the price of deploying applications in the cloud can be lower, due to lower hardware costs,
	// there will be more effective usage of physical resources.
	//
	// When it comes to the computing power or network bandwidth, large cloud providers such as, Amazon or Google cannot be easily beaten.
	// Their cloud infrastructure is huge. Since they provide services to many different clients, they buy large, high-performance systems that offer performance
	// levels much higher than a small company can afford to run internally
