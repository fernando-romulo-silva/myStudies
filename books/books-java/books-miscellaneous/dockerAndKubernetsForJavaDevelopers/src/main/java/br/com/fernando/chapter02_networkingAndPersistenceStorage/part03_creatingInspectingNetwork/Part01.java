    // This is the simplest form of the command, and yet it will probably be used the most often.
    // It takes a default driver (we haven't used any option to specify a driver, we will just use the default one, which is bridge).
    //
    // One of the most important parameters is the -d (--driver) option, with the default value bridge.
    //
    // As you remember, Docker has a couple of drivers available by default: host, bridge, and none.
