    // When doing basic web applications for the people in your office, going with the microservice architecture may be overkill.
    //
    // If your application is growing larger in features and functionality than you expected, or you know that from the beginning,
    // you may want to start breaking features off into microservices.
    //
    // You should try to do the functional decomposition and point out the fragments of your systems that have clear boundaries
    // and which would need scaling, and separate deployments in the future.
    //
    // If you need to scale only the service that needs to handle higher workload
