	// Deploying on the Kubernetes Cluster

	// We begin the process of deploying our software on the Kubernetes cluster by defining a service. 
	// As you remember from Chapter 7, Introduction to Kubernetes, services abstract a set of Pods as a single IP and port, 
	// allow simple TCP/UDP load, and allow the list of Pods to change dynamically.
