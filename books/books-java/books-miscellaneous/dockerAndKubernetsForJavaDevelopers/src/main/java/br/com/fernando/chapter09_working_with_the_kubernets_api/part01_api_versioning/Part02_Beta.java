	// The beta level totally different from the alpha level of the API, code is tested (it still may have some bugs, as it is still not the stable release). 
	// Also, in contrast to the alpha level, features in beta will not be dropped in the future releases.
	//
	// You are also encouraged to provide feedback from using beta, this will make Kubernetes better for everyone of us using it.
