    // Whatâ€™s Ingress ? 
    // An ingress is a set of rules that allows inbound connections to reach the kubernetes cluster services.
    // 
    // Typically, the kubernetes cluster is firewalled from the internet. 
    // It has edge routers enforcing the firewall. 
    // Kubernetes resources like services, pods, have IPs only routable by the cluster network and are not (directly) accessible outside the cluster.
    //
    // For minikube users: minikube addons enable ingress
    //
    // The ingress controller
    //
    // In order for the Ingress resource to work, the cluster must have an Ingress controller running.
    //
    // When a user requests an ingress by POSTing an Ingress resource (such as the one above) to the API server, the Ingress controller is responsible for fulfilling the Ingress, usually with a loadbalance
    //
    // There are readily available third-party ingress controllers like the Nginx, Traefik, HAproxy controllers which you could easily leverage. 
    //
    // echo "$(minikube ip) wildfly.info jetty.info" | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts
